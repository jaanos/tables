# Tables of parameters for graphs, association schemes and finite geometries

This repository contains mirror images of the data on graphs, association schemes and finite geometries from the homepages of [Andries E. Brouwer](http://aeb.win.tue.nl/), [Jason S. Williford](http://www.uwyo.edu/jwilliford/), and [G. Eric Moorhouse](http://ericmoorhouse.org/). The webpages are downloaded daily, with git providing the ability to track changes.

Currently, the following pages are mirrored:
* [Descriptions of various graphs](graphs/), containing also the [tables of feasible parameters for strongly regular graphs](graphs/srg/srgtab.html), by A. E. Brouwer
* [Tables of feasible intersection arrays for distance-regular graphs](drg/drgtables.html) by A. E. Brouwer
* Tables of feasible parameter sets for [primitive 3-class](qpoly/qprim3table.html), [*Q*-bipartite 4-class](qpoly/tableqbip4.html) and [*Q*-bipartite 5-class](qpoly/tableqbip5.html) *Q*-polynomial association schemes by J. S. Williford
* [Tables of known projective planes of small order](moorhouse/pub/planes/) by G. E. Moorhouse
* [Tables of known generalised polygons of small order](moorhouse/pub/genpoly/) by G. E. Moorhouse

You can track changes on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jaanos/tables/) (commits containing changes to the website are attributed to A. E. Brouwer, J. S. Williford or G. E. Moorhouse), or you can view the pages as a [GitHub Pages site](https://jaanos.github.io/tables/).
