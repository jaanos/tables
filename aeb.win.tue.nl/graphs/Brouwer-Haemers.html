<h1>Brouwer-Haemers graph</h1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 81, <i>k</i> = 20, &lambda; = 1, &mu; = 6,
namely the <a href="VO.html">affine orthogonal graph</a> VO<sup>–</sup>(4,3).
Construction is folklore. An early reference is Mesner (1964).
Uniqueness was proved by Brouwer & Haemers (1992).
The spectrum is 20<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>60</sup> (–7)<sup>20</sup>.
<p>
<h2>Group</h2>
The full group of automorphisms is
3<sup>4</sup>:((2&times;S<sub>6</sub>).2)
acting rank 3, with point stabilizer (2&times;S<sub>6</sub>).2.
<p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
(i) This is the graph on the vectors of a 4-dimensional vector space
over GF(3) provided with a quadratic form of Witt index 1,
where two vectors are adjacent when the quadratic form
vanishes on their difference.
(We have O<sup>–</sup><sub>4</sub>(3) = A<sub>6</sub>, which has
index 2 in PGO<sup>–</sup><sub>4</sub>(3) = S<sub>6</sub>, which has
index 2 in GO<sup>–</sup><sub>4</sub>(3) = 2&times;S<sub>6</sub>,
which again has index 2 in the group preserving the form up to a constant.)
<p>
A symmetric representation is found by taking
<bf>1</bf><sup>perp</sup>/<bf>1</bf> in a 6-dimensional vector space
over GF(3) provided with "sum of squares", i.e. the weight,
where two vertices are adjacent when their difference has weight 3.
<p>
And instead of taking sum 0 (that is, <bf>1</bf><sup>perp</sup>),
we can also take sum 1 (or sum 2).
<p>
(ii) Equivalently, take the points of AG(4,3), adjacent when the
joining line hits a fixed elliptic quadric in the hyperplane at infinity.
<p>
(iii) This graph also is the Hermitean forms graph on GF(9)<sup>2</sup>.
<p>
(iv) This graph also is the coset graph of the truncated ternary Golay code.
<p>
(v) This graph also is the graph on GF(81) where two points are adjacent
when their difference is a fourth power.
<p>
<h2>Supergraphs</h2>
This graph is the second subconstituent of the
<a href="U4_3.html">GQ(3,9) collinearity graph</a>.
Consequently, it is also found inside the
<a href="McL.html">McL graph</a>.
<p>
<h2>Cocliques</h2>
This graph has 324 maximal 6-cocliques,
68445 maximal 9-cocliques,
338580 maximal 10-cocliques,
87480 maximal 11-cocliques,
21060 maximal 12-cocliques,
and 324 maximal 15-cocliques.
No other maximal cocliques occur.
<p>
The 324 15-cocliques form a single orbit, with stabilizer Sym(6).
The stabilizer has three orbits, of sizes 15+60+6, where such
orbits of size 6 are the maximal 6-cocliques.
Such cocliques are most easily seen in the representation
of ternary vectors of length 6 with sum 1, modulo the all-1 vector.
Each vertex has a unique representative of weight 1, 2, or 3,
and there are 6+15+60 such vectors.
<p>
<h2>Chromatic number</h2>
This graph has chromatic number 7 [E. van Dam].
<!-- Willem reports that Edwin found this; I checked and agree -->
<p>
<h2>Second subconstituent</h2>
The second subconstituent &Delta; of &Gamma; has spectrum
14<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>40</sup> (–4)<sup>10</sup> (–6)<sup>9</sup>.
The automorphism group of &Delta; is (2<sup>2</sup>&times;S<sub>6</sub>).2,
twice as large as the point stabilizer of the automorphism group of &Gamma;.
<p>
<font size="-2">
Blokhuis, Brouwer & Haemers show that &Delta; is uniquely determined
by its spectrum. Sketch of the proof:
If the adjacency matrix is A, then (A–2I)(A+4I)(A+6I) = 72J
and it follows that each vertex is in 4 triangles.
The local graph is 6K<sub>1</sub>+4K<sub>2</sub> (for otherwise
some point neighbourhood would contain seven isolated points
and the 4&times;4 matrix of average row sums for the partition
with sizes 1+7+7+45 would have 2nd largest eigenvalue larger than 2,
contradiction). The matrix B = 4J–(A+2I)<sup>2</sup>+16I is psd
so that two nonadjacent vertices have at least 2 and at most 6 common
neighbours. We find a representation of &Delta; in real 10-space,
with vectors of squared norm 2, and inner products –&lambda; for
adjacent vertices, and 4–&mu; for nonadjacent vertices.
<!--this latter observation also implies that &lambda; is 0 or 1-->
B satisfies JB=0 and AB=–4B and B<sup>2</sup>=12B so that the rows
of B are integral vectors with sum 0 and squared norm 24.
If rows x and y of B are identical, then &mu;(x,y) = 2 and we see
two 2's and at least 14 –1's in each row, and the row sum is nonzero,
contradiction. It follows that the representation is injective:
we have 60 distinct roots. Now examination of the root system shows
that it must be A<sub>5</sub>+A<sub>5</sub>, and uniqueness follows.
