<H1>Cameron graph</H1>
There is a rank 4 strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 231, <i>k</i> = 30, &lambda; = 9, &mu; = 3.
The spectrum is 30<sup>1</sup> 9<sup>55</sup> (â€“3)<sup>175</sup>.
It is the unique strongly regular graph with these parameters
that is a gamma-space with lines of size 3.
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
The vertices are the (22 choose 2) = 231 pairs from a fixed 22-set S
provided with a fixed Steiner system S(3,6,22).
Two pairs are adjacent when they are disjoint and their 4-point union
is contained in a block.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The automorphism group is M<sub>22</sub>.2 of order 887040,
acting rank 4 with point stabilizer 2<sup>5</sup>:Sym(5).
<p>
<H2>Gamma space</H2>
This graph is the collinearity graph of a partial linear space
with lines of size 3, namely the triples of pairs that partition
a block of the Steiner system. This geometry is a gamma space:
given a line L, each point outside L is collinear to 0, 1, or 3
points of L. It has Fano subplanes, 10 on each point and 2 on each line.
The 15 lines and 10 planes on a fixed point form the edges and vertices
of the <a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>.
We see a <a href="GQ22.html">GQ(2,2)</a> subgeometry on each block.
<p>
<H2>Triple cover</H2>
This graph has a triple cover on 693 vertices with full group
3.M<sub>22</sub>.2.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
<p>
a) <i>A symbol</i>.
&Gamma; has 2765664 21-cocliques falling in 29 orbits of sizes
22, 352, 2310, 4620, 5280, 12320, 18480, 21120, 24640, 27720,
36960 (5x), 49280 (2x), 73920, 110880 (2x), 147840 (5x),
221760 (2x), 443520 (2x).
Since 21 is the Hoffman bound on the size of a coclique, these cocliques
are maximal, and each vertex outside one has 3 neighbours inside.
For two of these 29 orbits the stabilizer of a coclique is transitive
on its 21 vertices. These are precisely the two orbits of cocliques
with a stabilizer that is maximal in Aut(&Gamma;).
These orbits have lengths 22 and 352. A coclique in the former is called
a <i>symbol</i>, one in the latter a <i>heptad</i> (see c below).
There are 22 symbols, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>3</sub>(4).2 with vertex orbit sizes 21+210.
<p>
b) <i>A quad</i>.
&Gamma; has 77 quads, subgeometries GQ(2,2), forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>4</sup>:S<sub>6</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 15+120+96.
<p>
c) <i>A heptad</i>.
There are 352 of these (21-cocliques, see above), forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is A<sub>7</sub> with vertex orbit sizes
21+105+105 (the pairs in the heptad, meeting the heptad in 1 symbol,
and those outside the heptad).
<p>
d) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 231 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>5</sup>:S<sub>5</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 1+30+160+40.
The relation defined by the orbit of size 40 is the
<a href="Johnson.html">triangular graph</a> T(22).
<p>
The local graphs are 2-clique extensions of the line graph
of the <a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>.
<p>
e) <i>A Fano plane</i>.
There are 330 of these, maximal 7-cliques on which the lines induce
a Fano plane, forming a single orbit. The stabilizer of one is
2<sup>3</sup>.L<sub>3</sub>(2) x 2 with vertex orbit sizes
7+28+84+112. These are the only maximal cliques.
<p>
f) <i>A decad / Sylvester subgraph / GO(2,1)</i>.
Let our S(3,6,22) be obtained by deriving S(5,8,24) twice, so that
there are two outside symbols a and b. There are 1288 splits of the
set of 24 symbols into two dodecads. Of these splits, 616 have
a and b on the same side, and 672 have them on different sides.
Let a <i>decad</i> be a set of ten symbols that together with a and b
form a dodecad.
<!--
The graph &Gamma; does not contain any further Sylvester or GO(2,1)
subgraphs. So, for both Sylvester and GO(2,1) subgraphs we have:
-->
There are 616 decads, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup> (of order 1440)
with vertex orbit sizes 30+36+45+120.
On the orbit of size 36 &Gamma; induces a
<a href="Sylvester.html">Sylvester graph</a>.
On the orbit of size 45 &Gamma; induces a GO(2,1)
(generalized octagon of order (2,1), the flag graph of GQ(2,2),
on 45 = 1+4+8+16+16 vertices).
<p>
g) <i>An undecad / L2(11) subgraph</i>.
Let an <i>undecad</i> be a set of eleven symbols that together with
a or b form a dodecad.
There are 672 of these forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>2</sub>(11):2
with vertex orbit sizes 55+66+110.
The graph induced on the orbit of size 55 has valency 6 and point
stabilizer S<sub>4</sub>, see <a href="L211on55.html">L<sub>2</sub>(11)
on 55</a>.
