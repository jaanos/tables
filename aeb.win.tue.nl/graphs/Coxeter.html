<H1>Coxeter graph</H1>
<img src="pics/coxeter.png">
<p>
There is a unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{3,2,2,1;1,1,1,2}. It has 28 vertices and spectrum 3<sup>1</sup>
2<sup>8</sup> (√2 – 1)<sup>6</sup> (–1)<sup>7</sup> (–√2 – 1)<sup>6</sup>.
This is the graph that Coxeter calls "My graph".
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms is PGL(2,7) = L<sub>3</sub>(2).2,
acting distance-transitively with point stabilizer D<sub>12</sub>.
It is 3-arc-transitive.
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
This is the graph on the triangles in the Fano plane, where triangles
are adjacent when they are disjoint.
<p>
Equivalently, this is the graph on the antiflags of the Fano plane,
where (P,L) is adjacent to (Q,M) when P,Q are not on L,M.
<p>
<H2>Supergraphs</H2>
The Coxeter graph is a subgraph of the Odd graph O<sub>4</sub>
(of the disjoint triples of a 7-set), and hence also of the
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
Substructures belonging to the maximal subgroups of the automorphism group:
<p>
a) <i>partition into three 7-gons and a 7-coclique</i>
There are 8 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 7:6,
with vertex orbit sizes 7+21.
(There are 24 heptagons. The set of 7 neighbours of a heptagon
is a 7-coclique corresponding to a Fano plane. There are 8 such
Fano 7-cocliques, each adjacent to three heptagons.)
<p>
b) <i>A 4-set, all mutual distances 4</i>. 
There are 14 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>4</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 4+12+12.
These correspond to the antiflags containing
a given point or a given line.
The graph on these 4-sets, adjacent when they have nonempty
intersection, is the <a href="Heawood.html">Heawood graph</a>.
<p>
c) <i>A pair of edges at distance 4</i>.
There are 21 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is D<sub>16</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 4+8+8+8.
These correspond to the flags of the Fano plane.
<p>
d) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 28 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is D<sub>12</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 1+3+6+12+6.
These correspond to the antiflags of the Fano plane.
<p>
<H2>Circuits and Hamiltonicity</H2>
The Coxeter graph is maximally non-Hamiltonian:
there is a Hamiltonian path between any two nonadjacent vertices.
<p>
The girth is 7. The binary code generated by the cycles has
parameters [42,15,7], with weight enumerator
<pre>
 0:  1
 7:  24
 8:  21
 9:  56
10:  84
12:  140
13:  336
14:  528
15:  896
16:  987
17:  1344
18:  2296
19:  3024
20:  3360
21:  3760
22:  4368
23:  4200
24:  3087
25:  2184
26:  1428
27:  560
28:  84
</pre>
Thus, there are 24 7-gons and 21 8-gons and no 11-gons.
The 84 words of weight 28 are disjoint unions of two 14-gons - their
complements are the 84 complete matchings.
In particular, the Coxeter graph is 3-edge-colorable.
(By Brooks' theorem it is also 3-colorable.)
