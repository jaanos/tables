<h1>Desargues graph</h1>
There is a unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{3,2,2,1,1;1,1,2,2,3}. It has 20 vertices and spectrum
3<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>4</sup> 1<sup>5</sup> (-1)<sup>5</sup>
(-2)<sup>4</sup> (-3)<sup>1</sup>.
It is the bipartite double of the Petersen graph.
<p>
The name is derived from Desargues' theorem, that describes
a configuration of 10 points and 10 lines. The Desargues graph
is the bipartite point-line incidence graph of that configuration.
<p>
This configuration is found as the configuration of 10 internal points
and 10 elliptic lines for a conic in PG(2,5).
