<H1>The Sp(4,2) Generalized Quadrangle</H1>
<p>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 15, <i>k</i> = 6, &lambda; = 1, &mu; = 3,
and spectrum 6<sup>1</sup> 1<sup>9</sup> (−3)<sup>5</sup>.
It is the complement of the Triangular graph T(6).
<p>
<H2>Generalized Quadrangle</H2>
&Gamma; is the collinearity graph of the unique generalized quadrangle
GQ(2,2), that can be defined as having as points the 15 pairs from a 6-set
and as lines the 15 partitions of that 6-set into three pairs,
with natural incidence.
<p>
This generalized quadrangle is the Sp(4,2) generalized quadrangle,
consisting of the 15 projective points and 15 totally isotropic lines
of a 4-dimensional vector space over GF(2) provided with nondegenerate
symplectic form.
<p>
This generalized quadrangle is self-dual.
It has six ovoids, namely the six sets (of size 5) consisting of all
pairs containing a fixed symbol. Dually, it has six spreads.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms of &Gamma; is Sym(6),
acting rank 3 with point stabilizer S<sub>4</sub> &times; 2.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
Substructures belonging to the maximal subgroups of the automorphism group:
<p>
a) <i>A 5-coclique</i>.
There are 6 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>5</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 5+10.
The subgraph induced on the 10 is the
<a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>.
These are the six ovoids.
<p>
b) <i>A partition of the points into lines</i>.
There are 6 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>5</sub>,
with vertex orbit size 15. These are the six spreads.
<p>
c) <i>A 3x3 grid</i>.
There are 10 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 3<sup>2</sup>:D<sub>8</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 9+6.
The subgraph induced on the 9 is the 3x3 grid, that is,
the generalized quadrangle GQ(2,1).
The subgraph induced on the 6 is K<sub>3,3</sub>, that is,
the generalized quadrangle GQ(1,2).
<p>
d) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 15 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>4</sub> &times; 2
with vertex orbit sizes 1+6+8.
The subgraph induced on the 8 is the cube 2<sup>3</sup>.
<p>
e) <i>A line</i>.
There are 15 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>4</sub> &times; 2
with vertex orbit sizes 3+12.
<p>
<H1>The incidence graph</H1>
The point-line incidence graph &Delta; of this geometry is the unique
distance-regular graph with intersection array {3,2,2,2;1,1,1,3}.
It has spectrum 3<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>9</sup> 0<sup>10</sup>
(−2)<sup>9</sup> (−3)<sup>1</sup>.
It is known as <a href="cages/cages.html">Tutte's 8-cage</a>.
<p>
This graph is also found as the graph on the orthonormal bases
in PG(2,9) with a conic, adjacent when they have a point in common.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms of &Delta; is Sym(6).2,
acting distance transitively with point stabilizer
S<sub>4</sub> &times; 2.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
Substructures belonging to the maximal subgroups of the automorphism group:
<p>
a) <i>6 points and 6 lines, pairwise nonincident</i>.
There are 10 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 3<sup>2</sup>:D<sub>8</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 6+9+9+6.
<p>
b) <i>5-sets with all distances 4</i>.
There are 12 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>5</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 5+10+15.
<p>
c) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 30 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>4</sub> &times; 2
with vertex orbit sizes 1+3+6+12+8.
<p>
d) <i>A pair of disjoint decagons</i>.
There are 36 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 10:4
with vertex orbit sizes 10+20.
(There are 72 pentagons in &Gamma;, and 72 decagons in &Delta;
the vertices nonadjacent to a decagon form another decagon;
the remaining vertices, adjacent to both decagons, induce 5K<sub>2</sub>.)
These are the pairs {ovoid,spread} of the geometry.
If we call two such pairs (O,S) and (O',S') adjacent when
the unique point in both O and O' lies on the unique line
in both S and S', then we obtain the
<a href="Sylvester.html">Sylvester graph</a>.
<p>
e) <i>An edge</i>.
There are 45 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one has order 2<sup>5</sup>
with vertex orbit sizes 2+4+8+16.
The subgraph induced on the 16 is the union of two octagons.
