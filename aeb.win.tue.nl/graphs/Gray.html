<H1>Gray graph</H1>
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Gray_Marion.html">Marion Cameron Gray</a>
found in 1932 a graph that was first published in 1968 by Bouwer:
a cubic graph on 54 vertices with girth 8 that is <i>semisymmetric</i>,
i.e., edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive.
Malnič et al. showed in 2002 that this is the smallest
cubic semisymmetric graph.

<H2>Construction</H2>
In the generalized quadrangle GQ(2,4), remove the lines
from 3 disjoint GQ(2,1)'s. What is left is a geometry
with 27 points and 27 lines, three points on each line
and three lines on each point.
The point-line incidence graph is the Gray graph.
<p>
Equivalently, take the point-line incidence graph of
the Hamming cube H(3,3) (where now the rôles of points and lines
are reversed).

<H2>Group</H2>
The group is 3<sup>3</sup>:(S<sub>4</sub>&times;2) of order 1296.
It is transitive on the points and on the lines and on the
edges (incident point-line pairs), but is not vertex transitive.
The point (line in H(3,3)) stabilizer is D<sub>8</sub>&times;S<sub>3</sub>.
The line (point in H(3,3)) stabilizer is S<sub>4</sub>&times;2.
(Both of order 48.)

<H2>Spectrum</H2>
The Gray graph has spectrum
±3<sup>1</sup>, (±√6)<sup>6</sup>, (±√3)<sup>12</sup>, 0<sup>16</sup>,
and is the unique graph with this spectrum.
<!-- aeb: there are 4 graphs cospectral with H(3,3), namely H(3,3),
its dual, and two with nonregular local graphs [Haemers-Spence].
Here the halved graphs have regular local graphs since they are
just 3K2 locally, and one halved graph determines the other half -->
