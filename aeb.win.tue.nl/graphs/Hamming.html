<H1>Hamming graphs</H1>

<p>
Richard W. Hamming (1915-1998) did pioneering work in coding theory.
The <i>Hamming scheme</i> is named after him. It is the association
scheme where the elements are vectors of length <i>d</i> over some
alphabet of size <i>q</i>. The relation (called <i>Hamming distance</i>)
of two vectors is the number of coordinates where they differ.
<p>
The Hamming graph H(<i>d</i>,<i>q</i>) is the graph that describes
the distance-1 relation in the Hamming scheme. It is the direct product
of <i>d</i> complete graphs of size <i>q</i>. For <i>d</i> = 2
one gets the <i>q</i>&times;<i>q</i> <i>grid</i>, also known as the
<i>lattice graph</i> of order <i>q</i>.
<p>
The Hamming graph H(<i>d</i>,<i>q</i>) is distance-regular of
diameter <i>d</i>. In particular, for <i>d</i> = 2 it is
strongly regular, and the parameters are
<i>v</i> = <i>q</i><sup>2</sup>,
<i>k</i> = 2(<i>q</i> - 1),
&lambda; = <i>q</i> - 2,
&mu; = 2.

<H2>Lattice graphs</H2>
The graphs H(2,<i>q</i>) are also known as the <i>Lattice graphs</i>
L<sub>2</sub>(<i>q</i>). They are uniquely determined by their
parameters, except for <i>q</i>=4, in which case one has one more
graph, the <a href="Shrikhande.html">Shrikhande graph</a>,
with the same parameters.
<p>
The lattice graph L<sub>2</sub>(<i>q</i>) has independence number <i>q</i>
and chromatic number <i>q</i>.
<p>
The complement of the lattice graph L<sub>2</sub>(<i>q</i>)
also has independence number <i>q</i> and chromatic number <i>q</i>.
<p>
The lattice graph L<sub>2</sub>(3) is isomorphic to its complement.
It is the <a href="Paley.html">Paley graph</a> of order 9.
<p>
<H2>Spectrum</H2>
The Hamming graph H(<i>d</i>,<i>q</i>) has eigenvalues
(<i>q</i>–1)<i>d</i>–<i>qi</i> with multiplicities
(<i>d</i> choose <i>i</i>).(<i>q</i>–1)<sup><i>i</i></sup>
for <i>i</i>=0,...,<i>d</i>.
<p>
The graph H(2,<i>q</i>) is uniquely determined by its spectrum
when <i>q</i> is not 4.<br>
The graph H(3,<i>q</i>) is uniquely determined by its spectrum
when <i>q</i> is at least 36 (Bang-van Dam-Koolen), but not
when <i>q</i>=3 or <i>q</i>=4.
(There are four graphs with the spectrum of H(3,3),
namely H(3,3), the graph on the lines of H(3,3), and two more.
There are at least two graphs with the spectrum of H(3,4),
namely H(3,4) and a Doob graph.)
