<h1>Heawood graph</h1>

<p>
Percy John Heawood (1861-1955) was an English mathematician who
spent a large amount of time on questions related to the four colour
theorem.

There is a unique distance-regular graph &Gamma; with intersection array
{3,2,2;1,1,3}. It has 14 vertices and spectrum
3<sup>1</sup> (√2)<sup>6</sup> (–√2)<sup>6</sup> (–3)<sup>1</sup>.
It is the point-line incidence graph of the Fano plane,
and is commonly called the Heawood graph.
It occurs as subgraph of the
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>.
<p>
It is the unique (3,6)-<a href="cages/cages.html">cage</a>: the regular
cubic graph of girth 6 with minimal number of vertices.

<h3>co-Heawood graph</h3>
The point-line nonincidence graph of the Fano plane is the
distance-3 graph of the above, and is distance-regular with
intersection array {4,3,2,1,2,4} and spectrum 4<sup>1</sup>
(√2)<sup>6</sup> (–√2)<sup>6</sup> (–4)<sup>1</sup>. It is sometimes called
the <i>co-Heawood graph</i>. It occurs as subgraph of the
<a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>, and is the
first subconstituent of the <a href="U3_3.html">U<sub>3</sub>(3) graph</a>.

<h2>Group</h2>
The full group of automorphisms is PGL(2,7) = L<sub>3</sub>(2).2,
acting distance-transitively with point stabilizer S<sub>4</sub>.
<p>
<h2>Subgraphs</h2>
Substructures belonging to the maximal subgroups of the automorphism group:
<p>
a) <i>A partition of the edges into three matchings</i>.
There are 8 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 7:6,
with vertex orbit size 14.
(There are 24 matchings. The complement of a matching is a
14-cycle that decomposes uniquely into two matchings. So,
matchings come in groups of three.)
<p>
b) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 14 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>4</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 1+3+6+4.
<p>
c) <i>An edge</i>.
There are 21 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is D<sub>16</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 2+4+8.
These correspond to the flags of the Fano plane.
<p>
d) <i>A crossing non-edge</i>.
(The graph is bipartite; a crossing non-edge is a non-edge
meeting both sides of the bipartition.)
There are 28 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is D<sub>12</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 2+6+6.
These correspond to the antiflags of the Fano plane.
The graph on the crossing non-edges, adjacent when
their union is a 4-coclique, is the
<a href="Coxeter.html">Coxeter graph</a>.
<p>
<h2>Map</h2>
Heawood proved the 7-color theorem for the torus.
This graph has an embedding on the torus with 7 areas that are
mutually adjacent, showing that 7 is best possible.
