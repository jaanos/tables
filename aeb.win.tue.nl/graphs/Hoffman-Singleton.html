<H1>Hoffman-Singleton graph</H1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 50, <i>k</i> = 7, &lambda; = 0, &mu; = 1.
The spectrum is 7<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>28</sup> (–3)<sup>21</sup>.
<p>
It was found by Hoffman & Singleton as example of a Moore graph
(a graph of diameter d and girth 2d+1; such graphs are regular,
and if the diameter is 2, and the valency is k,
the number of vertices is <i>k</i><sup>2</sup> + 1).
Two other Moore graphs are known, namely the pentagon
and the <a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>.
If there are other Moore graphs, they must have valency 57 and
3250 vertices.
<p>
The Hoffman-Singleton graph is the (7,5)-<a href="cages/cages.html">cage</a>.
<p>
It is Hamiltonian.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms is G = PSU(3,5).2 acting rank 3,
with point stabilizer S<sub>7</sub>.
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
A simple direct construction is the following:
Take five pentagons P<sub>h</sub> and five pentagrams Q<sub>i</sub>,
so that vertex j of P<sub>h</sub> is adjacent to vertices j–1,j+1
of P<sub>h</sub> and vertex j of Q<sub>i</sub> is adjacent to
vertices j–2,j+2 of Q<sub>i</sub>. Now join vertex j of P<sub>h</sub>
to vertex hi+j of Q<sub>i</sub>. (All indices mod 5.)
<p>
The second construction uses the fact that it is possible to
identify the 35 lines of PG(3,2) with the 35 triples from a 7-set
in such a way that intersecting lines correspond to triples that
have precisely one element in common. Now take as vertices the
15 points and 35 lines of PG(3,2), let the points form a coclique,
let a point be adjacent to a line when they are incident,
and let two lines be adjacent when the corresponding triples
are disjoint.
<p>
The third construction produces the
<a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a>, together with
a split into two copies of &Gamma;. In the
<a href="S.html">Steiner system</a> S(4,7,23), fix an symbol <i>a</i>.
Construct the Higman-Sims graph on 1+22+77 points by taking a point <i>x</i>,
the 22 symbols distinct from <i>a</i> and the 77 blocks containing <i>a</i>,
where blocks are adjacent when they meet precisely in {<i>a</i>}.
Now let B be a block of S(4,7,23) not containing <i>a</i>.
We find a partition (1+7+42)+(15+35) of the 1+22+77 induced by B
(the 42 blocks are those meeting B in one point, the 35 those
meeting B in three points), and both 1+7+42 and 15+35 induce a
Hoffman-Singleton graph.
<p>
<H2>Supergraphs</H2>
As we saw, &Gamma; is subgraph of the
<a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a> on 100 vertices.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
We give the substructures of &Gamma; associated to the 7 maximal
subgroups of G distinct from PSU(3,5), sorted according to
increasing orbit size.
<p>
a) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 50 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one (in the full automorphism group)
is S<sub>7</sub> with vertex orbit sizes 1+7+42.
The subgraph induced on the second subconstituent is
the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{6,5,1;1,1,6}.
<p>
b) <i>A 15-coclique</i>.
There are 100 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is A<sub>7</sub> with vertex orbit sizes 15+35.
The complement of a 15-coclique is the unique distance-regular graph
with intersection array {4,3,3;1,1,2}, namely the
<a href="Odd.html">Odd graph</a> O<sub>4</sub>
of disjoint triples in a 7-set. It has full group S<sub>7</sub>,
with point stabilizer S<sub>3</sub>&times;S<sub>4</sub>.
The group is twice that of the Hoffman-Singleton graph since
this graph can be extended to a Hoffman-Singleton graph in two ways;
both occur in the Higman-Sims graph.
<p>
Two 15-cocliques meet in 0 (7x), 3 (35x), 5 (42x), 8 (15x) or 15 (1x) points.
Meeting in 0, 5 or 15 is an equivalence relation, and the collection
of 100 15-cocliques is the union of two collections of size 50.
Being disjoint induces the structure of a Hoffman-Singleton graph
on both.
<p>
The graph on the 15-cocliques, adjacent when they meet in 8 points,
is the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{15,14,10,3;1,5,12,15}. It has full group PSU(3,5).2 with
point stabilizer A<sub>7</sub> and edge stabilizer L<sub>2</sub>(7):2
(see below).
<p>
The graph on the 15-cocliques, adjacent when they meet in 0 or 8
is the <a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a>.
<p>
The two sets of 50 15-cocliques and the 50 vertices play a similar role
(and there is an outer automorphism that interchanges the three).
Thus, we can make a graph on 150 vertices, regular of valency 37,
with a partition 50+50+50 such that the union of any two parts
is the Higman-Sims graph.
<p>
c) <i>Split into two copies of 5C<sub>5</sub></i>.
There are 126 of these, forming a single orbit.
(The construction given above gives an explicit split.)
The stabilizer is 5<sub>+</sub><sup>1+2</sup>:8:2
with vertex orbit size 50.
<p>
d) <i>An edge</i>.
There are 175 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup>
with vertex orbit sizes 2+12+36.
<p>
The line graph of the Hoffman-Singleton graph is the unique
distance-regular graph with intersection array {12,6,5;1,1,4}.
Its distance-2 graph is strongly regular with parameters
<i>v</i> = 175, <i>k</i> = 72, &lambda; = 20, &mu; = 36.
(It is the collinearity graph of a partial geometry pg(5,18,2)
constructed by Haemers. The collinearity graph of the dual pg(18,5,2)
has parameters <i>v</i> = 630, <i>k</i> = 85, &lambda; = 20, &mu; = 10,
and full automorphism group Alt(7), transitive on the points.)
<p>
The subgraph induced on the orbit of size 36 is
the <a href="Sylvester.html">Sylvester graph</a>,
the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{5,4,2;1,1,4}.
<p>
e) <i>A pair of disjoint 15-cocliques</i>.
There are 350 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is M<sub>10</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 20+30.
<p>
The subgraph induced on the orbit of size 20 is 10K<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
The subgraph induced on the orbit of size 30 is
<a href="cages/cages.html">Tutte's 8-cage</a>, the incidence graph
of the generalized quadrangle GQ(2,2).
<p>
f) <i>A Petersen graph</i>.
There are 525 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2S<sub>5</sub>.2
with vertex orbit sizes 10+40.
<p>
The subgraph induced on the orbit of size 40 is the unique
(6,5)-<a href="cages/cages.html">cage</a>.
<p>
Each hexagon of &Gamma; is contained in a unique Petersen graph.
<p>
Each Petersen graph is split 5+5 in 6 splits into two 5C<sub>5</sub>.
Each split into two 5C<sub>5</sub></i> determines 25 Petersen graphs.
Each pair of splits determines a unique Petersen graph.
In this way we find the unital in PG(2,5<sup>2</sup>), with
splits into two 5C<sub>5</sub> as points, and Petersen graphs as lines.
<p>
g) <i>A Heawood graph</i>.
There are 750 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>2</sub>(7):2
with vertex orbit sizes 8+14+28.
The 14 induces the <a href="Heawood.html">Heawood graph</a>.
<p>
Heawood subgraphs are equivalent to pairs of 15-cocliques
meeting in 8 points: each half occurs in a unique 15-coclique
and these two 15-cocliques meet in 8 points (and conversely,
two 15-cocliques meeting in 8 points carry a Heawood graph
on their symmetric difference).
<p>
The 28 induces the <a href="Coxeter.html">Coxeter graph</a>.
<p>
<H2>Independence and chromatic number</H2>
The Hoffman-Singleton graph has independence number 15,
and chromatic number 4. It has edge-chromatic number 7.
The complement of the Hoffman-Singleton graph has independence number 2,
and chromatic number 25.
<p>
<H2>Paths and cycles</H2>
Aut(&Gamma;) is transitive on the induced paths of length 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
It has three orbits on paths P<sub>7</sub> (of length 6).
Aut(&Gamma;) is transitive on the induced cycles of length 5, 6, 7.
It has two orbits on cycles C<sub>8</sub>.
<p>
<H2>Locally Hoffman-Singleton graphs</H2>
No locally Hoffman-Singleton graphs are known.
Such a graph cannot be distance-transitive (van Bon).
If a locally Hoffman-Singleton graph is distance-regular, it
must have intersection array {50,42,9; 1,2,42} or {50,42,1; 1,2,50}
(Gavrilyuk & Makhnev), and cannot be vertex-transitive
(Gavrilyuk, Guo & Makhnev).
Any locally Hoffman-Singleton graph has diameter at most 6.
(Proof: by Weetman c<sub>i</sub>-graphs have degree at least i–1,
so that the diameter is at most 8. If it is 8, then &Gamma;
contains a disconnected induced subgraph with degree at least 3,
which contradicts interlacing. If it is 7, then &Gamma;
contains a disconnected induced subgraph of which one component
is a circuit and the other component has degree at least 3.
But the subgraphs far from a C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>, P<sub>6</sub>
do not have degree at least 3.)
