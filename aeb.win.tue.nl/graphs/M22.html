<H1>M<sub>22</sub> graph</H1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 77, <i>k</i> = 16, &lambda; = 0, &mu; = 4.
The spectrum is 16<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>55</sup> (â€“6)<sup>21</sup>.
Construction is folklore. An early reference is Mesner (1964).
Uniqueness was proved by Brouwer (1983).
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
The graph is the block graph of the <a href="S.html">Steiner system</a>
S(3,6,22), where blocks are called adjacent when they are disjoint.
It is strongly regular because this design is quasi-symmetric:
block intersections have size 0 or 2.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
Its automorphism group is M<sub>22</sub>.2 of order 887040,
acting rank 3 with point stabilizer 2<sup>4</sup>:Sym(6).
<p>
<H2>Supergraphs</H2>
The graph is the subgraph of the
<a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a> induced
on the set of vertices at distance 2 from a given vertex.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
a) <i>A 21-coclique</i> or <i>Gewirtz graph</i>
There are 22 cocliques of size 21, forming a single orbit.
(In the S(3,6,22) description these are the 22 symbols.
In the Higman-Sims graph these are neighbourhoods
of the points outside the 77.)
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>3</sub>(4).2 with
vertex orbit sizes 21+56. The subgraph induced on the 56
is the <a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>.
Two 21-cocliques meet in 5 points, so a 21-coclique and
a Gewirtz subgraph meet in 0 or 16 points.
<p>
Concerning cocliques of other sizes: &Gamma; has maximal
cocliques of the following sizes:
<pre>
size number
 7: 330
10: 216832
11: 149184
13: 43120
14: 330
16: 1309
21: 22
</pre>
<p>
b) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 77 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>4</sup>:S<sub>6</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 1+16+60.
<p>
c) <i>An Odd graph O<sub>4</sub></i>.
The <a href="Odd.html">Odd graph</a> O<sub>4</sub> is the graph
on the disjoint triples in a 7-set.
There are 352 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is A<sub>7</sub> with vertex orbit sizes 35+42.
The subgraph induced on the 42 is the second subconstituent of the
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>.
In the Steiner system S(5,8,24), let <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> be two
fixed symbols, such that our S(3,6,22) is the derived design at
{<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>}. Our 352 things are the 352 octads that contain
precisely one of <i>a</i>,<i>b</i>.
<p>
d) <i>A pair of 21-cocliques</i>.
There are 231 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>5</sup>:S<sub>5</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 5+32+40.
The subgraph induced on the 32 is the
<a href="Folded-6-cube.html">folded 6-cube</a>.
<p>
e) <i>Maximal 7-cocliques</i>.
There are 330 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>3</sup>:L<sub>3</sub>(2)&times;2
with vertex orbit sizes 7+56+14.
The subgraphs induced on the 7 and the 14 are the maximal 7- and 14-cocliques.
In the Steiner system S(5,8,24), let <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> be two
fixed symbols, such that our S(3,6,22) is the derived design at
{<i>a</i>,<i>b</i>}. Our 330 things are the 330 octads that contain
neither <i>a</i> nor <i>b</i>, and the orbits of size 7,56,14
correspond to intersection size 0,2,4.
<p>
f) <i>An edge</i>.
There are 616 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup>
with vertex orbit sizes 2+30+45.
The subgraph induced on the 30 is the point-line incidence graph
of the generalized quadrangle GQ(2,2).
The subgraph induced on the 45 is the distance-2 graph of
the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{4,2,2,2;1,1,1,2}, the generalized octagon GO(2,1), the flag
graph of GQ(2,2).
<p>
g) <i>Incidence graph of complement of biplane on 11 points</i>.
The unique biplane on 11 points has parameters 2-(11,5,2).
The complementary design is a 2-(11,6,3), with incidence graph
that is distance regular with intersection array {6,5,3;1,3,6}.
There are 672 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>2</sub>(11):2
with vertex orbit sizes 22+55.
<p>
<H2>Chromatic number</H2>
The chromatic number is 5.
(If no 21-coclique is used as a colour then at least 77/16 colours
are needed. If a 21-coclique is used, then what is left is the
Gewirtz graph, and that has chromatic number 4.)
<p>
<H2>Cycles</H2>
This graph is Hamiltonian.
