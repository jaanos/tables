<h1>The Octad Graph</h1>
There is a unique distance-regular graph &Gamma; with intersection array
{30,28,24; 1,3,15}. It has <i>v</i> = 759 vertices, valency <i>k</i> = 30,
and diameter <i>d</i> = 3. The spectrum is
30<sup>1</sup>  7<sup>252</sup>  (−3)<sup>483</sup>  (−15)<sup>23</sup>.
It is the collinearity graph of a near hexagon.
Construction of &Gamma; is folklore. 
The near hexagon is due Shult & Yanushka (1980).
Uniqueness of &Gamma; is Theorem 11.4.1 in [BCN], an immediate corollary
of the uniqueness of the near hexagon (Brouwer (1983)).

<h2>Construction</h2>
Let C be the extended binary Golay code C.
If Ω is the 24-set of coordinate positions of C, and
X the set of supports of the 759 vectors of weight 8 in C,
then (Ω,X) is the unique <a href="S.html">Steiner system</a> S(5,8,24),
one of the Witt designs.
The graph &Gamma; is the block graph of (Ω,X): the vertices are the
elements of X (called <i>octads</i> since they are certain 8-subsets of Ω),
and two vertices are adjacent when they are disjoint.

<h2>Group</h2>
The automorphism group of &Gamma; is M<sub>24</sub> of order 244823040,
acting distance-transitively with point stabilizer
2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>8</sub>.
Thus, M<sub>24</sub> is transitive on the points, and has 4 orbits
on pairs of points, corresponding to distance 0, 1, 2, 3.
See <a href="octadtriples.html">here</a> for the classification of
the orbits of M<sub>24</sub> on triples of points.

<h2>Near hexagon geometry</h2>
The graph &Gamma; is the collinearity graph of the point-line geometry
of which the points are the 759 octads, and the lines the 3795 partitions
of Ω into three pairwise disjoint octads. Each point is on 15 lines,
and each line has 3 points.
<p>
This point-line geometry is a <i>near polygon</i>: for each point x and each
line L there is a unique point on L closest (in graph distance) to x.
More precisely, it is a <i>near hexagon</i>, since &Gamma; has diameter 3.
Given a set S of points, let C(S) be the geodetic closure of S,
that is, the smallest subspace containing S that is closed for geodetics.
If x, y are points with d(x,y) = 2, then C({x,y}) is a subgeometry
with 15 points and 15 lines called a <i>quad</i>.
It is a generalized quadrangle of order 2.
The 15 lines and 35 quads on a fixed point x form the points and lines
of a geometry PG(3,2).
If Q is a quad, and z a point with d(z,Q)=2, then z has distance 2
to five points of Q, and these five points form an ovoid in Q.
See also [BCN], §11.4A.

<h2>Big ovoids and subgraphs on 506 vertices</h2>
There is a unique distance-regular graph &Delta; with intersection array
{15,14,12; 1,1,9}. It has 506 vertices, valency 15 and diameter 3.
The spectrum is 15<sup>1</sup>  (−8)<sup>22</sup>  4<sup>230</sup>
(−3)<sup>253</sup>. Uniqueness is due to Brouwer & Lambeck (1987).
<p>
Let ω be a fixed element of Ω. There are 253 octads that contain ω,
and 506 that do not contain ω. The graph &Delta; is the induced subgraph
in &Gamma; on the set of 506. The set of 253 is a big ovoid O: a set that meets
every line of the near polygon in precisely one point.
(Above we saw 5-point ovoids in a quad. These are the intersections
of a big ovoid and a quad. Also the intersections of four big ovoids.)
There are no other big ovoids than the 24 obtained in this way.
<p>
The 24 big ovoids are permuted by M<sub>24</sub>. The stabilizer of one
is M<sub>23</sub>, with vertex stabilizer 2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>7</sub>.
<p>
The full automorphism group of &Delta; is M<sub>23</sub>,
with vertex stabilizer A<sub>8</sub>.
The graph &Delta; is distance-transitive.
<p>
The intersection of &Delta; with a quad is a
<a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>.
For each vertex x of &Delta;, the 15 edges and 35 Petersen graphs
and 15 symbols (in Ω \ (x ∪ {ω})) form the points and lines and planes
of a geometry PG(3,2). See also [BCN], §11.4B.

<h2>Subgraphs on 330 vertices</h2>
There is a unique distance-regular graph E with intersection array
{7,6,4,4; 1,1,1,6}. It has 330 vertices, valency 7 and diameter 4.
The spectrum is 7<sup>1</sup>  4<sup>55</sup>  1<sup>154</sup>
(−3)<sup>99</sup>  (−4)<sup>21</sup>. Uniqueness is due to Brouwer (1986).
<p>
Let σ, τ be two fixed elements of Ω.
There are 77 octads that contain both σ and τ,
352 that contain precisely one, and 330 that contain neither.
The graph E is the induced subgraph in &Gamma; on the set of 330.
The full automorphism group of E is M<sub>22</sub>.2, with point stabilizer
2<sup>3</sup>:L<sub>3</sub>(2)×2.
The graph E is distance-transitive. See also [BCN], §11.4C.
