<h1>The dodecad graph</h1>
There is a strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
(<i>v</i>, <i>k</i>, &lambda;, &mu;) = (1288, 792, 476, 504).
The spectrum is 792<sup>1</sup> 8<sup>1035</sup> (–36)<sup>252</sup>.
Its complement has parameters
(<i>v</i>, <i>k</i>, &lambda;, &mu;) = (1288, 495, 206, 180)
and spectrum 495<sup>1</sup> 35<sup>252</sup> (–9)<sup>1035</sup>.
Construction is folklore. The graph is for example given in
Hubaut (1975). Uniqueness is unknown.

<h2>Construction</h2>
Let C be the extended binary Golay code.
It has 2576 words of weight 12 (dodecads), so 1288 complementary pairs
of dodecads. Given one dodecad, there are 1, 495, 1584, 495, 1 dodecads
at distance 0, 8, 12, 16, 24, respectively.
Given one complementary pair of dodecads, there are 1, 495, 792
such pairs at distance 0, 8, 12, respectively.
The graph &Gamma; is obtained if we call two dodecad pairs adjacent if
they have distance 12.
<!-- (Instead of taking dodecad pairs as vertices, one can also take
the words of weight 12 in the perfect binary Golay code.) -->

<h2>Group</h2>
The automorphism group of &Gamma; is M<sub>24</sub>
acting rank 3 with point stabilizer M<sub>12</sub>:2.

<h2>Supergraphs</h2>
This graph is the local graph of a strongly regular graph &Sigma;
with parameters
(<i>v</i>, <i>k</i>, &lambda;, &mu;) = (2048, 1288, 792, 840)
and spectrum 1288<sup>1</sup> 8<sup>1771</sup> (–56)<sup>276</sup>.
Its complement has parameters
(<i>v</i>, <i>k</i>, &lambda;, &mu;) = (2048, 759, 310, 264)
and spectrum 759<sup>1</sup> 55<sup>276</sup> (–9)<sup>1771</sup>.
The graph &Sigma; was constructed by Goethals and Seidel (1970),
who write `we have reasons to believe that the subgraph on the 1288
neighbours of any vertex is strongly regular'.
Uniqueness is unknown.

<h2>Construction</h2>
Let C be the extended binary Golay code. It has
1, 759, 2576, 759, 1 words of weight 0, 8, 12, 16, 24, respectively.
Take the 2<sup>11</sup> cosets of {<b>0</b>,<b>1</b>} in C,
and join two cosets when they have distance 12.

<h2>Group</h2>
The automorphism group of &Sigma; is 2<sup>11</sup>.M<sub>24</sub>
acting rank 3 with point stabilizer M<sub>24</sub>.
