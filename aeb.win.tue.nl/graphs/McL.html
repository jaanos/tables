<h1>Graph</h1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 275, <i>k</i> = 112, &lambda; = 30, &mu; = 56.
The spectrum is 112<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>252</sup> (–28)<sup>22</sup>.

The complementary graph has parameters
<i>v</i> = 275, <i>k</i> = 162, &lambda; = 105, &mu; = 81 and
spectrum 162<sup>1</sup> 27<sup>22</sup> (–3)<sup>252</sup>.

Uniqueness is due to Goethals & Seidel (1975).
For a detailed discussion see Brouwer & van Lint (1984).
<p>

<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms of &Gamma; is
G = McL.2 (of order 2<sup>8</sup>.3<sup>6</sup>.5<sup>3</sup>.7.11)
acting rank 3, with point stabilizer U<sub>4</sub>(3):2.
<p>

<H2>Construction</H2>
A 22+77+176 construction is found by taking
the Steiner system S(4,7,23) with 1+22 points
and 253 = 77+176 blocks, where the first 77 are those
containing the first point.
Use p,B,C to denote one of the 22, 77, 176 objects,
and let ~ denote adjacency.
Make the 22 remaining points a coclique,
let p ~ B when p is not in B,
let B ~ B' when B,B' meet in 1 point,
let p ~ C when p is in C,
let B ~ C when B,C meet in 3 points,
let C ~ C' when C,C' meet in 1 point.
This yields &Gamma;.
The resulting partition is equitable with parameters
(0,56,56), (16,16,80), (7,35,70).
<p>
The same construction in other words:
Take the 23 points and 253 blocks of S(4,7,23),
with points forming a coclique, p ~ B when p is not in B,
and B ~ B' when B,B' meet in 1 point. This yields a graph
on 276 vertices that is member of the switching class
of a regular two-graph. Now switch one point isolated
(and delete it) to get &Gamma;. See also h) below.

<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
We give the substructures of &Gamma; associated to the 11 maximal
subgroups of G not containing McL, sorted according to
increasing orbit size.
<p>
a) <i>Vertices</i>.
There are 275 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one (in the full automorphism group)
is U<sub>4</sub>(3):2 with vertex orbit sizes 1+112+162.
The graphs induced on the
<a href="U4_3.html">first</a> and <a href="U4_3a.html">second</a>
subconstituent are described separately.
<p>
b) <i>22-cocliques</i>.
There are 4050 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is M<sub>22</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 22+77+176.
The graph induced on the 77 is the <a href="M22.html">M<sub>22</sub>-graph</a>.
<p>
c) <i>Pairs of Hoffman-Singleton graphs</i>.
&Gamma; has an orbit of splits 50+50+175 where the 50's induce
the <a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>
and the 175 induces the graph on the edges of the Hoffman-Singleton graph,
adjacent when they are disjoint and lie in the same pentagon.
This latter graph is strongly regular with parameters
(v,k,&lambda;,&mu;) = (175,72,20,36).
If one takes the union of the two 50's and switches on this split
one obtains the <a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a>.
The stabilizer of a split 50+50+175 is U<sub>3</sub>(5):2, where
the outer 2 interchanges the two 50's.
There are 7128 such splits.
*** Other HoSi's in &Gamma;? ***
<p>
d) <i>5-cliques</i>.
There are 15400 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 3<sub>+</sub><sup>1+4</sup>:4S<sub>5</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 5+270.
<p>
e) <i>Edges</i>.
There are 15400 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 3<sup>4</sup>:(M<sub>10</sub> &times; 2)
with vertex orbit sizes 2+30+81+162.
The graph induced on the 81 is the
<a href="Brouwer-Haemers.html">VO<sup>–</sup><sub>4</sub>(3)</a> graph.
<p>
f) <i>Non-edges</i>.
There are 22275 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>3</sub>(4):2<sup>2</sup>
with vertex orbit sizes 2+56+105+112.
The graph induced on the 56 (the common neighbours) is the
<a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>.
<p>
g) <i>Odd graphs</i>.
&Gamma; contains an orbit of 22275
<a href="Odd.html">Odd graphs</a> O<sub>4</sub>.
The stabilizer of one is 2.S<sub>8</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 35+240.
There are other subgraphs O<sub>4</sub> in &Gamma;
since the local graph also contains such graphs.
*** Any further Odd subgraphs? ***
<p>
h) <i>Maximal 7-cocliques</i>.
There are 44550 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>7</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 7+16+112+140.
The 16 here is a maximal 16-coclique.
(This is what one gets from the regular two-graph construction
after switching a block isolated and deleting it.)
<p>

i) <i>Maximal 11-cocliques of the first kind</i>.
There are 113400 of these, forming a single orbit.
&Gamma; has three orbits of maximal 11-cocliques.
The first has stabilizer 2 &times; M<sub>11</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 11+22+110+132.
The 11 is a maximal 11-coclique, the 22 a (nice) 11K<sub>2</sub>.
(There is a unique nice 11K<sub>2</sub> on each 2K<sub>2</sub>,
but there are many others as well.)
The other two orbits of maximal 11-cocliques have
stabilizers of order 12 and 36, not transtive on the coclique.
<p>

j) <i>Splits 125+150</i>.
&Gamma; has an orbit of splits 125+150 with stabilizer
5<sub>+</sub><sup>1+2</sup>:3:8:2
with vertex orbit sizes 125+150.
The 125 induces a rank 5 strongly regular graph
with parameters (v,k,&lambda;,&mu;) = (125,52,15,26).
<p>

k) <i>3-Cocliques</i>.
There are 779625 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is
2<sup>2+4</sup>:(S<sub>3</sub>&times;S<sub>3</sub>)
<!-- 2<sup>4</sup>:3:2:2:3:2:2 -->
with vertex orbit sizes 3+8+32+64+72+96.
The orbit of size 8 induces a K<sub>4,4</sub>.

<H2>Cliques</H2>
The largest cliques have size 5. At first sight it looks like
&Gamma; might be the collinearity graph of a partial geometry
with 28 lines of size 5 on each point. However, this possibility
has been ruled out by Östergård & Soicher (2016).

<H2>Cocliques</H2>
The largest cocliques have size 22.
Numbers of maximal cocliques of given size (with orbit sizes):
<pre>
7: 44550
10: 13721400 = 1247400 + 12474000
11: 199697400 = 113400 + 49896000 + 149688000
13: 43659000 = 6237000 + 37422000
16: 757350 = 44550 + 712800
22: 4050
</pre>
<p>
The largest cocliques in the line graph have size 11
(and there are 254016000 of these, 181440 on each edge,
2240 on each pair of disjoint edges).

<H2>Chromatic number</H2>
The complement of &Gamma; has chromatic number 55.
That is, &Gamma; has a partition into 55 5-cliques.
