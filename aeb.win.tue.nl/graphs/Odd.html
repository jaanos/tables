<H1>Odd graphs</H1>
The <i>Odd graph</i> on a (2m+1)-set X, denoted by
O<sub>m+1</sub> (the subscript gives the valency),
is the graph on the m-subsets of this (2m+1)-set,
where disjoint m-subsets are adjacent.
<p>
This name is due to Biggs & Gardiner, who explain the
name by <i>since each edge can be assigned the unique
element of X which is not a member of either vertex
incident with that edge - the "odd man out"</i>.
<p>
The Odd graphs are distance-regular (of diameter m),
and uniquely characterized by their intersection array.
Their automorphism group is S<sub>2m+1</sub> with point
stabilizer S<sub>m</sub>&times;S<sub>m+1</sub>.
<p>
Odd graphs are <a href="Kneser.html">Kneser graphs</a>.
One has O<sub>m+1</sub> = K(2m+1,m).
<p>
Small examples:
<p>
O<sub>1</sub> is a loop on a single vertex.
<p>
O<sub>2</sub> is K<sub>3</sub>, the triangle.
Intersection array {2;1}.
<p>
O<sub>3</sub> is the <a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>.
Intersection array {3,2;1,1}.
<p>
O<sub>4</sub>, on 35 vertices, has intersection array {4,3,3;1,1,2}
and spectrum 4<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>14</sup> (-1)<sup>14</sup> (-3)<sup>6</sup>.
It is found as subgraph of the

<a href="U4_3.html">O<sup>-</sup><sub>6</sub>(3)</a> graph, and the
