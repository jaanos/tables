<H1>Pappus graph</H1>
The Pappus graph &Gamma; is the bipartite incidence graph of the
9 points and 9 lines of the affine plane AG(2,3) minus
a parallel class.
<p>
It is cubic, of girth 6.
It is the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{3,2,2,1; 1,1,2,3}.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
&Gamma; is distance transitive with group 3<sup>2</sup>:3:2:2:2 of order 216
with point stabilizer D<sub>12</sub>.
<p>
<H2>Spectrum</H2>
&Gamma; has spectrum ±3, (±√3)<sup>6</sup>, 0<sup>4</sup>
and is uniquely determined by its spectrum.
