<H1>Perkel graph</H1>
There is a unique distance-regular graph with intersection array
{6,5,2;1,1,3}. It has 57 vertices and spectrum
6 ((3±√5)/2)<sup>18</sup> (−3)<sup>20</sup>.
It is known as the Perkel graph.
Uniqueness is due to Coolsaet &amp; Degraer (2005).
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms is L<sub>2</sub>(19)
with point stabilizer Alt(5).
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
This is the graph with vertex set Z<sub>3</sub> x Z<sub>19</sub>
where (i,j) is joined to (i+1,k) when (k−j)<sup>3</sup> = 2<sup>6i</sup>.
<p>
For further constructions, see [BCN], p. 402.

The 60 cocliques of size 19 fall into 20 groups of 3 pairwise disjoint ones
(forming a 3-coloring). The three cocliques in one 3-coloring meet a
coclique in a different 3-coloring in 4, 6, 9 points.
<p>
The subgraph of the vertices at maximal distance from a given point
induces a dodecahedron.
<p>
Substructures belonging to the maximal subgroups of the automorphism group:
<p>
a) <i>A 3-coloring</i> (partition into 3 19-cocliques).
There are 20 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 19:9, transitive on the vertices.
<p>
b) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 57 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is Alt(5) with vertex orbit sizes 1+6+30+20.
<p>
c) <i>A Petersen subgraph</i>
There are 57 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is Alt(5) with vertex orbit sizes 5+10+12+30.
The orbits of size 5 form the 57 sets of five points, pairwise
at distance 3.
<p>
d) <i>An edge</i>.
There are 171 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is D<sub>20</sub> with vertex orbit sizes
2+5+10+10+10+20.
<p>
e) <i>An antipodal triple</i>.
An antipodal triple is a triple {x,y,z} with the property
that for each of the three points of the triple, the other two
points are antipodes in the dodecahedron (of diameter 5) at
distance 3 from the given point.
There are 190 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is D<sub>18</sub> with vertex orbit sizes
3+9+9+9+9+18.

<H2>Chromatic number</H2>
This graph is 3-chromatic.

<H2>Polygonal graph</H2>
This graph is a <a href="polygonal.html">5-gonal graph</a>,
that is, has a system S of pentagons such that each 2-claw
is contained in a unique pentagon in S.
