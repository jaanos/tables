<h1>The Petersen graph</h1>
<img src="pics/Petersen.jpg">
<p>
Julius Petersen (1839-1910) was a Danish mathematician.
Around 1898 he constructed the graph bearing his name
as the smallest counterexample against the claim that
a connected bridgeless cubic graph has an edge colouring
with three colours.

<h2>Construction</h2>
The Petersen graph is the complement of the
<a href="Johnson.html">Johnson graph</a> J(5,2).
Thus, it can be described as the graph with as vertex set
the pairs from a 5-set, where two pairs are joined when they
are disjoint. It is the unique strongly regular graph with
parameters <i>v</i> = 10, <i>k</i> = 3, &lambda; = 0, &mu; = 1,
and has spectrum 3<sup>1</sup> 1<sup>5</sup> (-2)<sup>4</sup>.
<p>
The Petersen graph is one of the Moore graphs (regular graphs of girth 5
with the largest possible number <i>k</i><sup>2</sup> + 1 of vertices).
Two other Moore graphs are known, namely the pentagon (<i>k</i> = 2)
and the <a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>
(<i>k</i> = 7). If there are other Moore graphs, they must have
valency 57 and 3250 vertices, but cannot have a transitive group.

<p>
The Petersen graph is also a <a href="cages/cages.html">cage</a>
(graph with smallest possible number of vertices given its
valency and girth).
<p>
<h2>Group</h2>
The full group of automorphisms is G = S<sub>5</sub> acting rank 3,
with point stabilizer 2&times;S<sub>3</sub>.
<p>
<h2>Supergraphs</h2>
The Petersen graph is contained in the
<a href="Clebsch.html">complement of the Clebsch graph</a> and the
<a href="GQ22.html">Sp(4,2) Generalized Quadrangle</a> and the
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>.
Its extended bipartite double is contained in the
<a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>.
<p>
<h2>Subgraphs</h2>
Substructures belonging to the maximal subgroups of the automorphism group:
<p>
a) <i>A 4-coclique</i>.
There are 5 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>4</sub>, with vertex orbit sizes 4+6.
The induced subgraph on the 6 is 3K<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
b) <i>A split into two pentagons</i>.
There are 6 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 5:4, with vertex orbit size 10.
There are 12 pentagons, with stabilizer D<sub>10</sub>.
<p>
c) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 10 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2&times;S<sub>3</sub>,
with vertex orbit sizes 1+3+6.
<p>
<h2>Independence and chromatic number</h2>
The Petersen graph has independence number 4 and chromatic number 3.
The five independent sets of size 4 are the sets of four pairs on a
given symbol. The twenty 3-colorings are found by taking two
independent sets of size four (they have one vertex x in common)
and the remaining triple (the neighbours of x).
<p>
<h2>Circuits and Hamiltonicity</h2>
The Petersen graph is maximally non-Hamiltonian:
there is a Hamiltonian path between any two nonadjacent vertices.
<p>
There are 12 pentagons, 10 hexagons, 0 heptagons, 15 octagons
20 nonagons and 0 decagons. The binary code spanned by the cycles
is a [15,6,5]-code. The 64 code words are the zero word,
the 12+10+15+20 = 57 cycles, and the 6 unions of two disjoint pentagons.
