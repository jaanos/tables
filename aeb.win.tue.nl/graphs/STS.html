<H1>Steiner triple systems</H1>
A <i>Steiner triple system</i> (of order <i>n</i>) STS(<i>n</i>)
is a 2-(<i>n</i>,3,1) design, that is, a Steiner system S(2,3,<i>n</i>),
in other words, a collection of 3-subsets of an <i>n</i>-set
such that any pair of elements of the <i>n</i>-set
is contained in a unique one among these 3-sets.
<p>
As was shown by Kirkman, a Steiner triple system of order <i>n</i> exists
if and only if either <i>n</i> = 0, 1, or <i>n</i> congruent to 1 or 3 (mod 6).
<p>
The unique Steiner triple system of order 7 is known as the <i>Fano</i> plane.
It is the (unique) projective plane of order 2.
The unique Steiner triple system of order 9 is the (unique) affine plane
of order 3.
Up to isomorphism, there are 2 Steiner triple systems of order 13,
and 80 of order 15, and 11084874829 of order 19.
<p>
The <i>block graph</i> of a Steiner triple system
is the graph with these 3-sets as vertices, where
two 3-sets are adjacent when they have nonempty intersection.
Such a graph is strongly regular, with parameters
<i>v</i> = <i>n</i>(<i>n</i> – 1)/6,
<i>k</i> = 3(<i>n</i> – 3)/2,
&lambda; = (<i>n</i> + 3)/2,
&mu; = 9.
<p>
More generally, the block graph of a
<a href="S.html">Steiner system</a> S(2,<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>)
is strongly regular.
<p>
Again more generally, the block graph of a quasi-symmetric design
is strongly regular.
