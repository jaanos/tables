Ludwig Schläfli (1814-1895) is the discoverer of the 27 lines
on a cubic surface.
<p>

<h1>Schläfli graph</h1>
The Schläfli graph &Gamma; is the unique strongly regular graph
with parameters <i>v</i> = 27, <i>k</i> = 16, &lambda; = 10, &mu; = 8.
<p>
It the E<sub>6</sub>(1) graph, the local graph of the E<sub>7</sub>(1)
(Gosset) graph.
Its local graph is the <a href="Clebsch.html">Clebsch graph</a>.
It is the complement of the collinearity graph of the unique
generalized quadrangle GQ(2,4).
<p>
This graph is uniquely determined by its parameters (Seidel).

<h2>Group</h2>
The full group of automorphisms is
G = W(E<sub>6</sub>) = U(4,2).2 = O<sup>–</sup>(6,2).2 = O(5,3).2
acting rank 3, with point stabilizer 2<sup>4</sup>:Sym(5).

<h2>The 27 lines on a smooth cubic surface</h2>
A nonsingular cubic surface contains 27 lines.
The graph on these 27 lines, adjacent when they meet,
is the complement of &Gamma;.
<p>
For example, the surface
X<sup>3</sup>+Y<sup>3</sup>+Z<sup>3</sup>+W<sup>3</sup> = 0
contains the 27 lines like <(1,–a,0,0),(0,0,1,–b)> where
a<sup>3</sup> = b<sup>3</sup> = 1.
(The values a, b can each be chosen in 3 ways, and the
coordinate split XY|ZW can be chosen in 3 ways, 27 choices
altogether.)
<p>
Each of these 27 lines intersects 10 others, and these 10 intersect in pairs,
so that each of the 27 lines is in 5 coplanar triples
and there are 45 coplanar triples altogether.
<p>
In the example, the lines
<(1,–a,0,0),(0,0,–b,c)> and <(1,0,–b,0),(0,–a,0,c)> and
<(1,0,0,–c),(0,a,–b,0)> are coplanar, and meet in the three points
(1,–a,–b,c), (1,–a,b,–c), (1,a,–b,–c).
In a field of characteristic 2 these three points coincide
and we find 45 points and 27 lines. Over GF(4) the surface is a unital,
and we see that the group is U(4,2).

<h2>Further constructions</h2>
&Gamma; is the complement of the collinearity graph of
isotropic points and totally isotropic lines in the
O<sup>–</sup>(6,2) geometry.

&Gamma; is the graph on the totally isotropic lines in the
U(4,2) geometry, adjacent when disjoint.

<h2>Subgraphs</h2>
We give the substructures of &Gamma; associated to the 5 maximal
subgroups of G distinct from U(4,2), sorted according to increasing
orbit size.
<p>
a) <i>A vertex</i>.<br>
There are 27 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is 2<sup>4</sup>:Sym(5) with vertex orbit sizes 1+10+16.
In the representation in O<sup>–</sup>(6,2) these are the isotropic points.
In the representation in U(4,2) these are the totally isotropic lines.
<p>
b) <i>A K<sub>2</sub>&times;K<sub>6</sub> subgraph (a "double six")</i>.<br>
There are 36 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is Sym(6)&times;2 with vertex orbit sizes 12+15.
The orbits of size 15 are the subsets that carry a sub-GQ(2,2) of GQ(2,4).
In the representation in O<sup>–</sup>(6,2) these are the nonisotropic points.
<p>
The largest cliques in &Gamma; have size 6, and &Gamma; has
72 6-cliques, forming a single orbit. The stabilizer
of one has orbit sizes 1+20+30+20+1 on them.
These 72 6-cliques form a root system of type E<sub>6</sub>,
where inner product 2, 1, 0, –1, –2 corresponds to intersection size
6, 3, 1, 0, 0. The last two orbits (20+1 6-cliques disjoint from a
given one) are distinguished since the 20 have distance 2 and the
1 has distance 3 to the given one in the graph on the 6-cliques,
adjacent when they have 3 points in common.
<p>
<img src="pics/e6.png" alt="diagram of the 72 roots of E6">
<p>
The antipodal quotient of this graph, that is, the graph
on the double sixes, is strongly regular with parameters
(v,k,&lambda;,&mu;) = (36,20,10,12).
<p>
The graph &Gamma; has 72+216 maximal cliques, namely the above
72 6-cliques, and 216 maximal 5-cliques, forming a single orbit.
These 5-cliques are 5-cocliques in GQ(2,4), the common neighbours
of two nonadjacent vertices,
and hence correspond to the edges of &Gamma;. The stabilizer
of a maximal 5-clique, that is, the stabilizer of an edge,
is Sym(5)&times;2 with vertex orbit sizes 2+5+10+10.
In the representation in O<sup>–</sup>(6,2) these are the
O<sup>–</sup>(4,2) elliptic quadrics.
<!--
the edges here are the "cross-edges in the K2xK6"
and correspond to ovoids in a GQ(2,2)
-->
<p>
c) <i>A nice partition into 3-cocliques</i><br>
GQ(2,4) contains 200 spreads falling into two orbits with sizes 40+160.
Dually, GQ(4,2) contains two types of ovoids (Brouwer & Wilbrink).
The unitary (GQ(4,2)) formulation distinguishes the 40
plane ovoids (determined by the 40 nonisotropic points)
and the 160 tripods (with 3x3=9 isotropic points on the three
hyperbolic lines pq, pr, ps where {p,q,r,s} is a basis
of nonisotropic points).
<p>
Of the nice ("plane") type there are 40, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is 3<sub>+</sub><sup>1+2</sup>:2S<sub>4</sub>.
In the representation in U(4,2) these are the nonisotropic points.
<p>
d) <i>A partition into three GQ(2,1)</i>.<br>
There are 40 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is 3<sup>3</sup>:(S<sub>4</sub>&times;2)
with vertex orbit size 27.
<p>
GQ(2,4) has 120 sub-GQ(2,1) forming a single orbit.
Each GQ(2,1) is disjoint from two others (that are disjoint)
and hence determines a unique partition.
<p>
<!--
In the representation in O(5,3) these are the isotropic points.
<p>
-->
In the representation in O<sup>–</sup>(6,2) these are the
ways of writing the space as orthogonal direct sum of three
elliptic lines O<sup>–</sup>(2,2): given any two O<sup>–</sup>(2,2)
their direct sum is a O<sup>+</sup>(4,2) with a GQ(2,1).
<p>
In the representation in U(4,2) these are the orthogonal bases
consisting of 4 nonisotropic points: any two basis points are
orthogonal to three isotropic points, and the basis determines
18 points of weight 2, that is, 18 lines of GQ(2,4).
The three splits of the basis into pairs determine the three GQ(2,1),
that are K<sub>3,3</sub> in GQ(4,2).
<p>
Given a 3GQ(2,1), the point-line incidence graph where the points
are the 27 vertices of &Gamma; and the lines are the 27 3-cocliques
not inside one of the three GQ(2,1), is the <a href="Gray.html">Gray graph</a>.
<p>
e) <i>A 3-coclique</i> (line in GQ(2,4)).<br>
There are 45 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is (2.(A<sub>4</sub> &times; A<sub>4</sub>).2).2
with vertex orbit sizes 3+24.
<!-- SL(2,3).2.2.3.2.2 -->
In the representation in O<sup>–</sup>(6,2) these are the totally
isotropic lines.
In the representation in U(4,2) these are the isotropic points.
<p>
<h2>Clique and Independence number</h2>
Maximal cliques in &Gamma; have size 6.
Maximal cocliques in &Gamma; have size 3.
As observed above, &Gamma; has chromatic number 9 and there are
two essentially different ways to color &Gamma; with 9 colors.
The complementary graph has chromatic number 6.
