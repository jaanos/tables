<h1>Suzuki graph</h1>
There is a rank 3 strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 1782, <i>k</i> = 416, &lambda; = 100, &mu; = 96.
The spectrum is 416<sup>1</sup> 20<sup>780</sup> (−16)<sup>1001</sup>.
It is one of the two graphs that are locally the
<a href="G24.html">G<sub>2</sub>(4) graph</a> (Pasechnik, 1993),
the other being the triple cover constructed by Soicher (1993),
a distance-transitive graph with intersection array
{416, 315, 64, 1; 1, 32, 315, 416}.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms is G = Suz.2 (of order
2<sup>14</sup>.3<sup>7</sup>.5<sup>2</sup>.7.11.13),
acting rank 3, with point stabilizer G<sub>2</sub>(4).2.
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
A geometric construction was given in Brouwer et al. (2009).

<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
We give the substructures of &Gamma; associated to the 15 maximal subgroups
of G distinct from Suz, sorted according to increasing orbit size.
<p>
a) <i>A vertex</i>.<br>
There are 1782 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is G<sub>2</sub>(4).2 with vertex orbit sizes
1+416+1365.
The subgraph induced on the first subconstituent is the
<a href="G24.html">G<sub>2</sub>(4) graph</a>, which is
strongly regular with parameters (v,k,&lambda;,&mu;) = (416,100,36,20).
<p>
b) <i>A U<sub>4</sub>(3) graph on 162 vertices</i>.<br>
Each element g of Atlas type 3A of Suz fixes 162 vertices of &Gamma;
and &Gamma; induces a <a href="U4_3a.html">U<sub>4</sub>(3) graph</a>
on these 162-sets. These U<sub>4</sub>(3) graphs are strongly regular
with parameters (v,k,&lambda;,&mu;) = (162,56,10,24).
There are 22880 of these (one for each subgroup &lt;g&gt; of G),
forming a single orbit. The stabilizer of one is
3<sub>2</sub>.U<sub>4</sub>(3).2<sup>2</sup><sub>133</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 162+1620.
<!-- check: no other such subgraphs? it seems i checked already - how? -->
<br>
The graph on these 22880 subgraphs, adjacent when disjoint, that is, when
the corresponding elements g commute, is the unique distance-regular graph
with intersection array {280,243,144,10; 1,8,90,280}, known as
the Patterson graph. (And distance 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in the Patterson graph
corresponds to intersection size 162, 0, 18, 12, 42 for these 162-sets.)
<br>
The 2080 U<sub>4</sub>(3) subgraphs on a vertex p induce the 2080
Gewirtz subgraphs in the G<sub>2</sub>(4) graph on the neighbours of p.
<p>
c) <i>Nice splits 6<sup>297</sup></i>.<br>
&Gamma; has a unique orbit (of size 32760) of partitions of the vertex set
into 297 maximal 6-cocliques such that the union of any two parts induces
a regular subgraph of &Gamma;.
(There are many other partitions into 297 maximal 6-cocliques.)
The stabilizer of one such partition is U<sub>5</sub>(2):2.
Let (just here) C<sub>6</sub>@2 denote the 2-coclique extension
of the hexagon. Then the union of any two parts of such a partition
induces either 6K<sub>2</sub> or C<sub>6</sub>@2.
Each partition carries the structure of a rank 3 strongly regular graph
with parameters (v,k,&lambda;,&mu;) = (297,40,7,5), the collinearity graph
of the generalized quadrangle GQ(8,4) that is the dual polar graph
for U<sub>5</sub>(2), if we call two maximal 6-cocliques adjacent
when their union induces C<sub>6</sub>@2.
<br>
The subgroup U<sub>5</sub>(2):2 of G (of index 32760) is transitive
on the 1782 vertices, but has two orbits on the edges,
giving a red subgraph of valency 160
and a green subgraph of valency 256.
And three orbits on the nonedges (with valencies 1280, 80, and 5),
the last of which gives our partition of the vertex set into 6-cocliques.
The local graph of the red graph is the disjoint union of five
2-coclique extensions of the <a href="Clebsch.html">Clebsch graph</a>.
<p>
d) <i>A 2-coclique extension of the Schläfli graph</i>.<br>
There are 135135 of these, forming a single orbit. The stabilizer of one is
2<sup>1+6</sup><sub>−</sub>.U<sub>4</sub>(2).2
with vertex orbit sizes 54+1728.
The graph induced on the orbit of size 54 is the
2-coclique extension of the <a href="Schlaefli.html">Schläfli graph</a>.
This graph has valency 32. Its local graph is the 2-coclique extension
of the <a href="Clebsch.html">Clebsch graph</a>.
The mu-graphs of &Gamma; consist of three copies of this graph on 32 vertices.
<p>
e) <i>A 3-edge-coloring</i>.<br>
The subgroup 3<sup>5</sup>:(M<sub>11</sub>&times;2) of G
(of index 232960) is transitive on the 1782 vertices, but
has three orbits on the edges, giving a red subgraph of valency 20,
the disjoint union of 22
<a href="Brouwer-Haemers.html">Brouwer-Haemers graphs</a>,
and a bipartite green subgraph of valency 36,
and a blue subgraph of valency 360.
<br>
The 22 Brouwer-Haemers graphs are permuted by M<sub>11</sub>&times;2
acting rank 3 with suborbits 1+1+20. The 1+1 induces a U<sub>4</sub>(3)
graph, as under b). Thus, &Gamma; has partitions into 11 U<sub>4</sub>(3)
graphs.
<p>
f) <i>An edge</i>.<br>
There are 370656 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is J<sub>2</sub>:2 &times; 2 with vertex orbit sizes
2+100+630+1050.
<p>
g) <i>A maximal 6-coclique</i>.<br>
There are 405405 of these, forming a single orbit. The stabilizer of one is
2<sup>4+6</sup>:3S<sub>6</sub> with vertex orbit sizes 6+240+1536.
The vertices in the 240-orbit have 4 neighbours in the 6-coclique,
those in the 1536-orbit have 1.
Each maximal 6-coclique lies in 24 splits as under c).
Each maximal 6-coclique lies in 64 U<sub>4</sub>(3) subgraphs,
and the maximal 6-cocliques of each U<sub>4</sub>(3) subgraph
remain maximal in &Gamma;.
<br>
Each vertex lies in 1365 maximal 6-cocliques. Each nonedge lies in 5.
Each non-edge xy lies in 1044 3-cocliques, on which the stabilizer
has orbits of sizes 20+1024, see below under i). Each triple xyz with
z in the orbit of size 20 lies in a unique maximal 6-coclique.
No triple xyz with z in the orbit of size 1024 lies in a maximal 6-coclique.
<br>
There are no smaller maximal cocliques. The largest cocliques have size 66.
<p>
h) <i>A nonincidence graph of PG(2,4)</i>.<br>
There are 926640 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is
(A<sub>4</sub> &times; L<sub>3</sub>(4):2<sub>3</sub>):2
with vertex orbit sizes 42+480+1260.
The graph induced on the orbit of size 42 is the bipartite
point-line nonincidence graph of PG(2,4).
<p>
i) <i>A non-edge</i>.<br>
There are 1216215 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is
2<sup>2+8</sup>:(S<sub>5</sub> &times; S<sub>3</sub>)
with vertex orbit sizes 2+20+96+640+1024.
The orbit of size 20 is a K<sub>5&times;4</sub> subgraph.
The orbit of size 96 is the mu-graph of &Gamma;.
<p>
j) <i>A 792+990 split</i>.<br>
The subgroup M<sub>12</sub>.2 &times; 2 of G (of index 2358720)
has vertex orbit sizes 792+990.
<p>
k) <i>A 324+1458 split</i>.<br>
The subgroup 3<sup>2+4</sup>:2(S<sub>4</sub> &times; D<sub>8</sub>)
of G (of index 3203200) has vertex orbit sizes 324+1458.
<p>
l) <i>A K<sub>6,6</sub></i>.<br>
There are 10378368 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is
(A<sub>6</sub>:2<sub>2</sub>&times;A<sub>5</sub>).2
with vertex orbit sizes 12+150+720+900.
<p>
m) <i>A 72+270+1440 split</i>.<br>
The stabilizer of one is ((3<sup>2</sup>:8) &times; A<sub>6</sub>).2
(of index 17297280) with vertex orbit sizes 72+270+1440
and valencies 26, 56 and 338, respectively.
Each 72 has a partition into 12 6-cliques.
For details, see Cliques, below.
<p>
n) <i>A 26K<sub>2</sub></i>.<br>
The subgroup L<sub>2</sub>(25).2<sub>2</sub> of G
(of index 57480192) has vertex orbit sizes 52+130+300+650+650.
The graph induced on the orbit of size 52 is 26K<sub>2</sub>.
<!-- are there further such subgraphs? -->
<p>
o) <i>A sub-Hoffman-Singleton graph</i>.<br>
The subgroup Sym(7) of G (of index 177914880) has vertex orbit sizes
42+120+210+210+360+420+420.
The graph induced on the orbit of size 42 is the 2nd subconstituent
of the <a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>,
distance-regular with intersection array {6,5,1; 1,1,6}.
<!-- are there further such subgraphs? -->

<H2>Cliques</H2>
There is a single orbit of maximal cliques. They have size 6.
The stabilizer is a non-maximal S<sub>6</sub> &times; S<sub>3</sub>
of order 4320. Each K<sub>6</sub> determines a unique 3K<sub>6</sub>.
Each 3K<sub>6</sub> determines a unique graph on 36 vertices of valency 20,
union of two copies of 3K<sub>6</sub>, with a partition in six 6-cocliques.
Each such graph determines a unique graph on 72 vertices of valency 26,
union of two of the preceding, with group
((3<sup>2</sup>:8) &times; A<sub>6</sub>).2, see m) above.

<H2>Maximal cocliques</H2>
The smallest maximal cocliques have size 6 and form a single orbit,
see above under g).
<p>
The largest cocliques have size 66 and form a single orbit
(Kuzuta, cf. Brouwer et al., 2009). The stabilizer of one
is U<sub>3</sub>(4):4 with vertex orbit sizes 1+65+416+1300.
The 1716 points outside a 66-coclique all have 16 neighbours inside,
and we find a 3-(66,16,21) design.
<!-- sizes 6,15-39,41-42,51,66 and possibly others occur -->
<!-- big cocliques can be found by noting that an outside vertex
has more than 13 nbrs inside; locally max is 16, next max 13;
locally five orbits of size 16; look for extensions; this should
find all cocliques of size at least 53 -->

<H2>Small cocliques</H2>
&Gamma; has two orbits of 3-cocliques: the stabilizer of a nonedge xy
has orbits 20+1024 on the vertices adjacent to neither x nor y.
Call the 3-cocliques in the small orbit <i>special</i>.
There are 8108100 special 3-cocliques, and the stabilizer of one
is 2<sup>4+6</sup>.3<sup>1+2</sup>.2<sup>2</sup>
<!-- of size 110592 -->
with vertex orbit sizes 3+3+48+48+144+768+768 (the first the 3-coclique
xyz itself, the others with 0, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1 neighbours in xyz,
respectively).
<p>
If xyz is a special 3-coclique, then 48 vertices are adjacent to all three
and the subgraph induced on this orbit of size 48 is
3K<sub>4&times;4</sub>.
<p>
There are 3+768 vertices (other than xyz) adjacent to none of xyz.
If uvw is this orbit of size 3, then uvwxyz is a maximal 6-coclique,
see above under g). All triples in uvwxyz are special.
The common neighbours of xyzw together with xyzw themselves
form a K<sub>5&times;4</sub>, see above under i).
<p>
If xyz is a nonspecial 3-coclique, then 21 vertices are adjacent to all three
and the subgraph induced is 6K<sub>1</sub>+3K<sub>5</sub>.
The 6K<sub>1</sub> part of this has 6 common neighbours,
and we find a K<sub>6,6</sub>, see above under l).
