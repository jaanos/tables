<H1>The O<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3) graph</H1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 112, <i>k</i> = 30, &lambda; = 2, &mu; = 10.
The spectrum is 30<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>90</sup> (–10)<sup>21</sup>.
This graph is the collinearity graph of the unique generalized
quadrangle GQ(3,9). (Any strongly regular graph with the parameters
of the collinearity graph of a GQ(<i>q</i>,<i>q</i><sup>2</sup>)
necessarily is one, by Cameron-Goethals-Seidel (1978).
And GQ(3,9) is unique by Dixmier-Zara (1976).)
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms of &Gamma; is
G = U<sub>4</sub>(3).D<sub>8</sub>
(of order 2<sup>10</sup>.3<sup>6</sup>.5.7) acting rank 3,
with point stabilizer
3<sup>4</sup>:((2&times;A<sub>6</sub>).2<sup>2</sup>).
This group is PGO*<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3) where the * denotes
that the form may be multiplied by a constant.
[Is there no standard name for this group?]
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
&Gamma; is the graph on the 112 isotropic points of
the O<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3) geometry,
adjacent when orthogonal, i.e., joined by a totally isotropic line.
<p>
&Gamma; can also be described as the graph on the 112 totally isotropic
lines of the GQ(9,3) on 280 points defined by U<sub>4</sub>(3),
adjacent when they meet.
<p>
Or again: In the <a href="S.html">Steiner system</a> S(5,8,24),
take all 112 blocks starting 110... or 101...;
join two blocks of the same kind when they have only two symbols
in common, and join two blocks starting differently when they
have four symbols in common. This yields &Gamma; (and shows that
it has a split into two <a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>s).
<p>
<H2>Supergraphs</H2>
&Gamma; is the first subconstituent of the
<a href="McL.html">McL graph</a> on 275 vertices.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
We give the substructures of &Gamma; associated to the 11 maximal
subgroups of G not containing U<sub>4</sub>(3), sorted according to
increasing orbit size.
<p>
a) <i>Vertices</i>.
There are 112 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one (in the full automorphism group)
is 3<sup>4</sup>:((2 &times; A<sub>6</sub>).2<sup>2</sup>)
with vertex orbit sizes 1+30+81. The
<a href="Brouwer-Haemers.html">second subconstituent</a>
VO<sup>–</sup><sub>4</sub>(3) (on 81 vertices) is again strongly regular,
with parameters (81,20,1,6).
It is the graph on the vectors of a 4-dimensional vector space over GF(3),
where two vectors are adjacent when the quadratic form vanishes on
their difference.
<p>
b) <i>Subquadrangles</i>.
There are 252 subquadrangles GQ(3,3) (namely, the subgraphs induced
on the perp of a nonisotropic point), forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is
U<sub>4</sub>(2):2&times;2 = PGO<sub>5</sub>(3)&times;2.
The vertex orbit sizes are 40+72.
<p>
c) <i>Lines</i>.
There are 280 4-cliques (namely, the totally isotropic lines),
forming a single orbit. The stabilizer of one is
3<sub>+</sub><sup>1+4</sup>.2<sub>–</sub><sup>1+4</sup>.D<sub>12</sub>.
The vertex orbit sizes are 4+108.
<p>
d) <i>Splits into two Gewirtz graphs</i>.
&Gamma; has 324 splits into two
<a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>s, forming a
single orbit. The stabilizer of one split is
L<sub>3</sub>(4).2<sup>2</sup>, and the stabilizer of one Gewirtz graph
is L<sub>3</sub>(4).2, of index 2 in the full automorphism group of the
Gewirtz graph. (Indeed, in the McLaughlin graph &Lambda; we find
&Gamma; as the set of neighbours of a vertex x, and the Gewirtz graph
as the set of common neighbours of two nonadjacent vertices x, y.
The stabilizer in McL:2 of {x,y} is the full group of the Gewirtz graph,
and the subgroup obtained by fixing both x and y has index 2 in it.)
<p>
There are 648 Gewirtz subgraphs, 324 on each point, 108 on each edge,
180 on each nonedge, 36 on each path of length 2, 12 on each K<sub>1,3</sub>,
4 on each quadrangle.
The intersection sizes are 0 or 56 (1x), 16 or 40 (42x), 20 or 36 (56x),
24 or 32 (105x), 28 (240x).
When two Gewirtz subgraphs C, D have nonempty intersection K,
then C and D are the only Gewirtz subgraphs on K in &Gamma;.
If the intersection K has size u, then the graph induced on K
is regular of valency (u–16)/4.
Fixing C and varying D we find all the 16-cocliques,
half of the 10 K<sub>2</sub>, all the 6 C<sub>4</sub>,
and half of the Coxeter graphs in C.
<p>
Equivalent to a split of the isotropic points of O<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3)
into two Gewirtz graphs is a collection of 315 elliptic lines, precisely
one in each tangent plane with a single isotropic point. Thus, there are
324 such collections.
<p>
In the U<sub>4</sub>(3) generalized quadrangle, this object is
equivalent to a collection of 315 K<sub>4,4</sub>'s (induced on
the union of two orthogonal hyperbolic lines), precisely one
on each edge. Such objects are visible inside the Patterson graph.
<p>
e) <i>Regular spreads</i>.
A nonisotropic point in the U<sub>4</sub>(3) geometry determines
a unital on its perp: 28 isotropic points, pairwise not joined
by a totally isotropic line. In the orthogonal geometry this
corresponds to a regular spread: a partition of the 112 isotropic points
into 28 totally isotropic lines, such that any two of these lines
determine a regulus: 4 lines in an O<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub>(3).
There are 540 nonisotropic points in the unitary geometry, forming
a single orbit. The stabilizer of one is (U<sub>3</sub>(3) &times; 4):2.
<p>
There are lots of other spreads: each time we see a regulus,
we can replace its four lines by the other four in their union
and obtain a new spread. Or, in unitary terms, we can replace a
hyperbolic line by its perp and obtain a new ovoid. However, there
are also spreads without any regulus.

<p>
f) <i>Bases</i>.
If we choose the quadratic form &Sigma; X<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>,
then we see a subgroup 2<sup>5</sup>:S<sub>6</sub>.
There are 567+567 = 1134 bases, of mutually orthogonal nonisotropic
points all of the same kind, forming a single orbit under
PGO*<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3); for PGO<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3)
they split into two orbits (all points with Q(x)=1 and all points
with Q(x)=2). The point stabilizer is 2<sup>5</sup>:S<sub>6</sub>.
In terms of the isotropic points these bases determine subgraphs
(of vectors of "weight" 6) of size 32. (They are the distance-3
graphs of <a href="Folded-6-cube.html">folded 6-cubes</a>,
distance-regular with intersection array {10,9,4;1,6,10}.)
All subgraphs with array {10,9,4;1,6,10} arise in this way.
These subgraphs are bipartite, and their halves form the 2268
maximal 16-cocliques.
<p>
g) <i>Elliptic lines</i>.
The orthogonal geometry has 2835 elliptic lines, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 4(S<sub>4</sub>&times;S<sub>4</sub>).2<sup>2</sup>.
In terms of the isotropic points the elliptic lines are the
O<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub>(3) subgeometries.
<p>
h) <i>Hyperbolic lines or nonedges</i>.
The orthogonal geometry has 4536 hyperbolic lines, forming a single orbit.
In terms of the graph on the isotropic points the hyperbolic lines are
the nonedges (and give a vertex partition 2+10+40+60).
A hyperbolic line has two isotropic points, one point with Q(x)=1
and one point with Q(x)=2. Therefore, fixing a hyperbolic line in
PGO<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3) implies fixing a nonisotropic point,
and the group is not maximal. But in PGO*<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3)
the stabilizer (A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup> &times; 2).2
<!--  = (2 &times; 2 &times; S<sub>6</sub>):2 -->is maximal.
<p>
i) <i>Odd graphs or maximal 7-cocliques</i>.
Our graph contains an orbit of 5184
<a href="Odd.html">Odd graphs</a> O<sub>4</sub>.
This is most easily seen by viewing the orthogonal geometry
as elliptic hyperplane in the O<sub>7</sub>(3) geometry.
That latter geometry can be described using the form
&Sigma; X<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>, and the point (1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
is elliptic. In its perp we see 112 = 7 + 35 + 70 points
(7: 1111110; 35: 1110000; 70: 1112220), where the 7-set is a maximal
coclique and the 35-set induces the Odd graph O<sub>4</sub>,
the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array {4,3,3;1,1,2}.
The stabilizer of a 7-coclique (or of an O<sub>4</sub>) is
S<sub>7</sub>. There are no other maximal 7-cocliques.
*** Are there any other Odd subgraphs? ***
<p>
j) <i>Triples of mutually orthogonal elliptic lines</i>.
There are 8505 triples of mutually orthogonal elliptic lines,
forming a single orbit. An elliptic line has two points with
Q(x)=1 and two with Q(x)=2, and hence a triple of mutually
orthogonal elliptic lines determines a unique basis consisting
of points with Q(x)=1, and a unique basis consisting of points
with Q(x)=2. It follows that the stabilizer of a triple of
mutually orthogonal elliptic lines is nonmaximal in
PGO<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3). However, it is maximal in
PGO*<sup>–</sup><sub>6</sub>(3), with stabilizer
4<sup>3</sup>(2&times;S<sub>4</sub>) =
2<sup>5</sup>.2<sup>3</sup>.S<sub>3</sub>.2.
<p>
k) <i>Unitary elliptic quadrics and even cocliques</i>
The graph on the 280 totally isotropic lines, adjacent when they meet,
has 9072 10-cocliques with the property that each point outside
is adjacent to 0 or 2 points inside. These form a single orbit
(but split into two orbits of size 4536 with stabilizer M<sub>10</sub>
for U<sub>4</sub>(3)). These 10-cocliques can be seen as elliptic quadrics:
<p>
The U<sub>4</sub>(3) geometry is defined by a nondegenerate
Hermitean form over GF(9).
When restricted to vectors with coordinates in GF(3), the
form becomes a quadratic form. This means that this geometry
contains O<sup>+</sup><sub>4</sub>(3) and O<sup>–</sup><sub>4</sub>(3)
substructures. The former becomes a pair of orthogonal nondegenerate
planes, but each such plane has three elliptic points, and a
pair of orthogonal nondegenerate planes is equivalent to a split
of a basis into 3+3. Thus, the corresponding subgroup is not maximal.
The latter becomes a set of ten pairwise disjoint lines such that
each t.i. line hits 0 or 2 of them.

<!--The map (x,y) -> (x+y,x–y) multiplies the form
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> by 2 and preserves orthogonality.
Consider our geometry as the direct sum of three elliptic lines,
acted upon by the direct sum of three copies of this map.-->
<p>
<H2>Cocliques</H2>
From the information on the maximal cocliques in the second subconstituent
we immediately derive the numbers of maximal cocliques of a given size here.
There are 5184 maximal 7-cocliques (see also under i)),
766584 maximal 10-cocliques, 3447360 maximal 11-cocliques,
816480 maximal 12-cocliques, 181440 maximal 13-cocliques,
and 2268 maximal 16-cocliques (see also under f)).
<p>
<H2>Chromatic number</H2>
This graph has chromatic number 8.
Indeed, 8 suffices since there is a split into two Gewirtz graphs
and Gewirtz has chromatic number 4. And 7 does not suffice:
there is no partition of the point set into seven 16-cocliques.
<!-- why not? by computer. Is there a nice argument? -->
<p>
<H2>Resolution</H2>
The 280 lines of GQ(3,9) can be partitioned into 10 spreads
(10 parallel classes of 28 lines, each a partition of the point set)
(Soicher (2019)).
