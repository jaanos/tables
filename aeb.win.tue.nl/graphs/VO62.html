<h1>The affine polar graphs on 64 vertices</h1>
We consider two <a href="VO.html">affine polar graphs</a> on 64 vertices,
namely VO<sup>+</sup>(6,2) and VO<sup>−</sup>(6,2).

<h2>VO<sup>+</sup>(6,2)</h2>
The graph VO<sup>+</sup>(6,2) is strongly regular with parameters
v = 64, k = 35, &lambda; = 18, &mu; = 20 and spectrum
35<sup>1</sup> 3<sup>35</sup> (−5)<sup>28</sup>.
<p>
It is isomorphic to the quadratic forms graph on GF(2)<sup>3</sup>,
and to the alternating forms graph on GF(2)<sup>4</sup>,
and to the complement of the folded halved 8-cube.
<p>
The local graphs (induced on the neighbours of a vertex)
are orthogonal graphs O<sup>+</sup>(6,2), strongly regular
with parameters v = 35, k = 18, &lambda; = &mu; = 9 and spectrum
18<sup>1</sup> 3<sup>14</sup> (−3)<sup>20</sup>. These are isomorphic to
the graph on the lines of PG(3,2), adjacent when intersecting.
<p>
The graphs induced on the nonneighbours of a vertex
are (non)orthogonal graphs NO<sup>+</sup>(6,2), strongly regular
with parameters v = 28, k = 15, &lambda; = 6, &mu; = 10 and spectrum
15<sup>1</sup> 1<sup>20</sup> (−5)<sup>7</sup>. These are isomorphic to the
complement of the <a href="Johnson.html">triangular graph</a> T(8).

<h2>VO<sup>−</sup>(6,2)</h2>
The graph VO<sup>−</sup>(6,2) is strongly regular with parameters
v = 64, k = 27,  &lambda; = 10, &mu; = 12 and spectrum
27<sup>1</sup> 3<sup>36</sup> (−5)<sup>27</sup>.
<p>
The local graphs are orthogonal graphs O<sup>−</sup>(6,2),
strongly regular with parameters v = 27, k = 10, &lambda; = 1, &mu; = 5
and spectrum 10<sup>1</sup> 1<sup>20</sup> (−5)<sup>6</sup>.
These are isomorphic to the collinearity graph of GQ(2,4),
and to the complement of the <a href="Schlaefli.html">Schläfli graph</a>.
<p>
The graphs induced on the nonneighbours of a vertex
are (non)orthogonal graphs NO<sup>−</sup>(6,2), strongly regular
with parameters v = 36, k = 15, &lambda; = &mu; = 6 and spectrum
15<sup>1</sup> 3<sup>15</sup> (−3)<sup>20</sup>.

<h2>Regular 2-graphs</h2>
These affine polar graphs and nonorthogonal graphs are
graphs in the switching class of regular 2-graphs with
2-transitive groups Sp(8,2) and Sp(6,2), respectively.
Switching a point isolated yields strongly regular graphs
on 63, 35, or 27 vertices. The parameters are
<p>
(i) v = 63, k = 30, &lambda; = 13, &mu; = 15 and spectrum
30<sup>1</sup> 3<sup>35</sup> (−5)<sup>27</sup>.
This is the orthogonal graph O(7,2), isomorphic to the
<a href="Sp.html">symplectic graph</a> Sp(6,2).
<p>
(ii) v = 35, k = 18, &lambda; = &mu; = 9.
This is the orthogonal graph O<sup>+</sup>(6,2) already seen above.
<p>
(iii) v = 27, k = 10, &lambda; = 1, &mu; = 5.
This is the orthogonal graph O<sup>−</sup>(6,2) already seen above.
