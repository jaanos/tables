<h1>Armanios-Wells graph</h1>
<p>
There is a unique distance-regular graph &Gamma; with intersection array
{5,4,1,1;1,1,4,5}. It has 32 vertices and spectrum
5<sup>1</sup> 2.236<sup>8</sup> 1<sup>10</sup> (-2.236)<sup>8</sup>
(-3)<sup>5</sup>.
It is known as the Wells graph, or the Armanios-Wells graph.
<p>
It is antipodal of diameter 4,
the unique double cover without 4-cycles of the folded 5-cube.
<p>
For each vertex, the subgraph on the vertices at distance 2 is the
dodecahedron. The dodecahedron is itself antipodal, of diameter 5,
and antipodal pairs at distance 5 in the dodecahedron are antipodal
at distance 4 in the Wells graph.
<p>
<h2>Group</h2>
The full group of automorphisms is 2<sub>-</sub><sup>1+4</sup>:Alt(5)
acting distance-transitively with point stabilizer Alt(5).
<h2>Independence number</h2>
The independence number is 10, and the only 10-cocliques
are the lifts of the 5-cocliques in the folded 5-cube.
<!-- indep. nr. of dodecahedron is 8, and the only 8-cocliques
are the lifts of the 4-cocliques in Petersen -->
<p>
<h2>Chromatic number</h2>
The chromatic number is 4.
<!-- at most 4: colour dodecahedron with 3 colors, etc.
at least 4: indep. nr is 10 -->
<p>
<h2>Characterization by spectrum</h2>
Van Dam and Haemers constructed by switching
a graph cospectral with the Wells graph, and E. Spence showed by computer
search that there are precisely three graphs with the spectrum of
the Wells graph.
<p>
<h2>History</h2>
In [BCN] this graph was called the Wells graph.
It was constructed by A. L. Wells (1983),
but also, presumably earlier, by C. Armanios (1981, 1985).
