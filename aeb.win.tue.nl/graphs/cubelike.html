<H1>Cubelike graphs</H1>
A <i>cubelike graph</i> is a Cayley graph where the underlying group G
is the elementary Abelian group of order 2<sup>m</sup>.
Thus, the vertex set is G, and two vertices are adjacent
when their difference is in S, the difference set of the graph.
<p>
For example, the <a href="Clebsch.html">Clebsch graph</a> is cubelike.
<p>
<H2>Spectrum</H2>
A cubelike graph has integral spectrum (Lovász).
<p>
<H2>Chromatic number</H2>
A cubelike graph does not have chromatic number 3 (Payan).
Examples of cubelike graphs with chromatic numbers 2<sup>t</sup> (for any t),
6 and 7 are known.
It is unknown whether there exists a cubelike graph with chromatic number 5.
<p>
<H2>Cubelike hull</H2>
Let X be an arbitrary graph, and let X<sub>0</sub> resp. X<sub>1</sub>
be the graphs that have as vertex set the collection of subsets of the
vertex set of X of even (odd) size, where two subsets are adjacent
when their symmetric difference is an edge of X.
Then X<sub>0</sub> and X<sub>1</sub> are isomorphic.
<p>
Put H(X) = X<sub>1</sub> and call it the <i>cubelike hull</i> of X.
The graph H(X) is cubelike, and contains X as an induced subgraph.
<p>
Any homomorphism &phi; : X → C, where C is cubelike,
extends to a homomorphism &psi; : H(X) → C.
This gives information on the chromatic number of C.
<p>
For example, if C is not bipartite, then it contains an odd cycle X,
but for a (2d+1)-cycle X the cubelike hull H(X) is the folded (2d+1)-cube
which has chromatic number 4. This proves Payan's theorem.
<p>
The cubelike hull H(X) of the complete graph K<sub>n</sub>
is the halved n-cube. Thus, if a cubelike graph C contains K<sub>5</sub>,
then there is a homomorphism from H(K<sub>5</sub>), the Clebsch graph,
into C, and hence C has chromatic number at least 8.
<p>
If X is cubelike, then X → H(X) → X, so that &chi;(H(X)) = &chi;(X).
<p>
<h2>Independence number and chromatic number of halved cubes</h2>
More generally, the chromatic number &chi;(H(K<sub>n</sub>)) satisfies
&chi;(H(K<sub>n</sub>)) ≥ 2<sup>n–1</sup> / &alpha;(H(K<sub>n</sub>)),
and &alpha;(H(K<sub>n</sub>)) equals the size of the largest binary code
of word length n and minimum distance 4. This explains the lower bounds
in the table below. (For the bounds on codes, see, e.g.,
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/codes/binary-1.html">this table</a>.)

<p>
Clearly the &chi;(H(K<sub>n</sub>)) are a non-decreasing function of n.
<p>
If n is a power of 2, then K<sub>n</sub> is cubelike, so that
&chi;(H(K<sub>n</sub>)) = &chi;(K<sub>n</sub>) = n for these n.
<p>
The upper bounds 14 and 15 for &chi;(H(K<sub>9</sub>)) and
&chi;(H(K<sub>10</sub>)) are due to Stefan Hougardy and Gordon Royle.

<H2>Projective formulation</H2>
The difference set S can be viewed as subset of the hyperplane
PG(m–1,2) at infinity of the affine geometry G. This means that
we have a (monotone) function "chromatic number" on the subsets
of a projective space over GF(2).
This number is 1 for the empty set, and 2 for sets contained in
the complement of a hyperplane (and only for these), and never 3.
<blockquote>
<font size="-1">
Proof: Suppose &chi;=2 and we have color classes A and B.
Let X be the hyperplane PG(m–1,2) at infinity.
Since A+s=B and B+s=A for any s in S, every even sum of elements of S is in X\S.
Let Y be the subspace of X spanned by S.
Then X\S contains the hyperplane of Y consisting of even sums of points in S,
and hence X\S contains a hyperplane of X.
</font>
</blockquote>
The chromatic number of the union of two sets is at most the product
of the chromatic numbers of both sets.
<p>
If S is disjoint from a subspace T of projective dimension t–1,
then the partition of G determined by T (into t-dimensional flats
with T at infinity) provides a coloring with 2<sup>m–t</sup> colors.
<p>
For m &lt; 5 the chromatic number only takes the values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
In PG(4,2), a nondegenerate quadric S has chromatic number 7.
For example, consider the quadric
Q(x) = &Sigma;x<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup> + &Sigma;x<sub>j</sub>x<sub>k</sub>
(summed over all i and j &lt; k) with nucleus (radical) {11111}
(where 11111 stands for (1,1,1,1,1)).
The isotropic points are the binary vectors of weights 3 and 4.
A 7-coloring of G is given by the six balls of radius 1 around
the vectors 11000, 10100, 00011, 01110, 01101, 10011 and the pair
{00000,11111}. It is easy to check that there is no 6-coloring.
<p>
In PG(4,2), S has chromatic number at most 4 if and only if
S is contained in the complement of a plane [Blokhuis].
(Indeed, suppose &chi;(S) ≤ 4 while S meets all planes.
A color with a monochromatic plane in AG(5,2) colors only
these four points, otherwise S would miss a plane.
For every color without monochromatic plane all pairs of points
with that color determine a different direction, so if the
colorclass has size k, we find (k choose 2) points outside S,
and k ≤ 7 since S contains more than 3 points.
So four colors do not suffice to color the 32 points of AG(5,2).)
