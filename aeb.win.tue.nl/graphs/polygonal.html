<H1>Polygonal graphs</H1>
A <i>near-polygonal</i> graph is a graph &Gamma; which has a set
C of m-cycles for some positive integer m such that each 2-claw
of &Gamma; is contained in exactly one cycle in C.
If m is the girth of &Gamma; then the graph is called <i>polygonal</i>.
<p>
The 1-skeleton of a regular solid is polygonal.
<p>
All <a href="recta/02graphs.html">rectagraphs</a> are 4-gonal graphs;
all (0,2)-graphs are near 4-gonal graphs.
<p>
The <a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a> and the
<a href="Perkel.html">Perkel graph</a> and the J<sub>1</sub> graph
are 5-gonal.
