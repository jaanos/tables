<H1>Strongly regular graphs</H1>
A <I>graph</I> is a collection of points, where certain pairs
of points are joined by an edge. It is a graphical representation
of a symmetric relation. There are lots of them.
A <I>strongly regular graph</I> is a very beautiful graph,
and there are not very many strongly regular graphs on a given
number of points. The definition is as follows.
<p>
A strongly regular graph with parameters
(<I>v</I>,<I>k</I>,<I>&lambda;</I>,<I>&mu;</I>)
is a graph with <I>v</I> points (vertices), such that each point
has precisely <I>k</I> neighbours (i.e., is joined by an edge to
precisely <I>k</I> other vertices), where the number of common
neighbours of two vertices equals <I>&lambda;</I> in case they
were neighbours, and equals <I>&mu;</I> in case they weren't.
<p>
In order to have well-defined <I>&lambda;</I> and <I>&mu;</I>,
we require that there is at least one pair of neighbours
(that is, <I>k</I> is not zero), and at least one pair of
non-neighbours (that is, <I>k</I> is less than <I>v−</I>1).
<p>
The complement of a strongly regular graph with parameters
(<i>v</i>, <i>k</i>, &lambda;, &mu;)
is again strongly regular, with parameters
(<i>v</i>, <i>v</i> − <i>k</i> − 1,
<i>v</i> − 2<i>k</i> + &mu; − 2, <i>v</i> − 2<i>k</i> + &lambda;).
<p>
Boring examples are obtained by putting a number of complete
graphs next to each other. The union of <I>m</I> complete
graphs, on <I>w</I> vertices each, is strongly regular with
parameters <I>v = mw</I>, <I>k = w−</I>1, <I>&lambda; = w−</I>2,
<I>&mu; = </I>0. The spectrum of such a graph is
<I>w−</I>1 (<I>m</I> times), <I>−</I>1 (<I>m(w−</I>1<I>)</I> times).
<p>
Equally boring are the complements of these boring graphs,
the complete multipartite graphs with <I>m</I> parts of size <I>w</I>.
They have parameters <I>v = mw</I>, <I>k = (m−</I>1<I>)w</I>,
<I>&lambda; = (m−</I>2<I>)w</I>, <I>&mu; = (m−</I>1<I>)w</I> and spectrum
<I>(m−</I>1<I>)w</I> (once), 0 (<I>m(w−</I>1<I>)</I> times), <I>−w</I>
(<I>m−</I>1 times).
<p>
Below we are only interested in non-boring graphs, that is,
we assume that 0<I> &lt; &mu; &lt; k</I>.
<p>
There are precisely four non-boring strongly regular graphs
on at most 12 vertices, and these have parameters (5,2,0,1),
(9,4,1,2), (10,3,0,1) and (10,6,3,4).
These are known as the pentagon,
the 3&times;3 <a href="Hamming.html">grid</a>, the
<a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>,
and the <a href="Johnson.html">triangular graph</a> T(5).
The first two are isomorphic to their complement, the last two are
complementary.
