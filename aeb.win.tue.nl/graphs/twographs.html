<H1>Two-graphs</H1>
Regular two-graphs were introduced by G. Higman in order to study
permutation representations of doubly transitive groups, and,
in particular, the action of Co.3 on 276 points.
The concept of switching class is due to J. J. Seidel, who studied
equiangular systems of lines in a Euclidean space.
<p>
A <i>two-graph</i> is a finite set provided with a collection of triples,
called <i>coherent</i>, such that each 4-set contains an even number
of coherent triples. The two-graph is called <i>regular</i> when
each pair of points is contained in the same number of coherent triples.
Trivial two-graphs are obtained by taking no triples, or all triples.
<p>
Given a graph &Gamma; on a set V of vertices, one obtains a two-graph
by taking all triples that contain an odd number of edges of &Gamma;.
Every two-graph arises in this way.
(One can for example stipulate that a given vertex <i>p</i> must be
isolated, and then <i>qr</i> must be an edge precisely when <i>pqr</i>
is a coherent triple.)
A graph and its complement give rise to two-graphs with complementary
sets of coherent triples.
<p>
Two graphs &Gamma;, &Delta; with the same vertex set V are called
<i>switching equivalent</i> when V is the disjoint union of subsets A and B,
and &Gamma; and &Delta; induce the same subgraph on A and on B, but
vertices a ∈ A and b ∈ B are joined in &Gamma; iff they are not joined
in &Delta;. Being switching equivalent is an equivalence relation,
and two graphs are switching equivalent precisely when they give rise
to the same two-graph.
<p>
The <i>Seidel adjacency matrix</i> of a graph &Gamma; is the matrix
S = J−I−2A that has zero diagonal, −1 for adjacency, and 1 for nonadjacency.
If &Gamma; and &Delta; are switching equivalent, their Seidel adjacency
matrices have the same spectrum. This common spectrum is called the
Seidel spectrum of the two-graph. The Seidel spectrum of the complementary
two-graph equals minus the Seidel spectrum of a given two-graph.

<H2>Example: the regular two-graph on 16 points</H2>
There is a unique complementary pair of nontrivial regular
<a href="twographs.html">two-graphs</a> on 16 points.
They have Seidel spectrum (−5)<sup>6</sup> 3<sup>10</sup>
and 5<sup>6</sup> (−3)<sup>10</sup>.
The switching class of the former contains the strongly regular graphs
with parameters (16,10,6,6) and (16,6,2,2), that is, the
<a href="Clebsch.html">Clebsch graph</a>, and the
<a href="Shrikhande.html">Shrikhande graph</a> and the lattice graph H(2,4).
It also contains the graph K<sub>1</sub>+T(6), the disjoint union
of the triangular graph T(6) and an isolated point.
The switching class of the latter contains the complements of these graphs.
These six graphs have the following spectra.

The automorphism group of the regular two-graph here is
2<sup>4</sup>:Sym(6) of order 11520. The automorphism groups
of the graphs in its switching class are subgroups.
