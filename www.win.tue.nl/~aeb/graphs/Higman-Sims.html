<H1>Higman-Sims graph</H1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph &Gamma; with parameters
<i>v</i> = 100, <i>k</i> = 22, &lambda; = 0, &mu; = 6.
The spectrum is 22<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>77</sup> (−8)<sup>22</sup>.
The graph was found by Higman & Sims (1969). Uniqueness was proved
by Gewirtz (1969). Earlier, this graph had been constructed, and
uniqueness was shown, by Dale M. Mesner (1964).
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms is G = HS.2, acting rank 3,
with point stabilizer M<sub>22</sub>.2.
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
<H3>1+22+77</H3>
The easiest construction is 1+22+77: take a vertex <i>x</i>,
let its 22 neighbours be the symbols and its 77 nonneighbours
be the blocks of the <a href="S.html">Steiner system</a> S(3,6,22),
where symbols form a coclique, symbols and blocks are adjacent
when incident, and blocks are adjacent when disjoint.
<p>
<H3>50+50</H3>
In the description of the
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>
we saw that the Higman-Sims graph is the graph on the 15-cocliques,
adjacent when they meet in 0 or 8 points. We also saw that vertices
and two sets of 50 15-cocliques play the same role, so one also
obtains the Higman-Sims graph by taking the vertices and one collection
of 50 15-cocliques in the Hoffman-Singleton graph, with the obvious
adjacencies.
<p>
<H3>30+70</H3>
Similar to the 15+35 construction of the Hoffman-Singleton graph
is the 30+70 construction of the Higman-Sims graph. In the former
the starting point was that the lines of PG(3,2) can be labeled
with the triples in a 7-set such that lines meet when the corresponding
triples have 1 element in common. This time we label the lines of
PG(3,2) with the 4+4 splits of an 8-set, where intersecting lines
correspond to splits with common refinement 2+2+2+2. Clearly, both
descriptions of the lines of PG(3,2) are isomorphic.
Take as vertices of the Higman-Sims graph the 15 points and 15 planes
of PG(3,2) together with the 70 4-subsets of an 8-set.
Join two 4-sets when they have 1 element in common. A 4-set determines
a 4+4 split and hence a line in PG(3,2), and is adjacent to the points
and planes incident with that line. A plane is adjacent to the nonincident
points. This yields the Higman-Sims graph.
<p>
<H2>Higman's geometry</H2>
In S(5,8,24), fix two symbols, and look at the two sets
of 176 blocks that contain precisely one of them.
Higman made a geometry, calling the blocks in one family "points"
and those in the other family "quadrics", where a point is incident
with a quadric when the blocks meet in 0 or 4 symbols.
This yields a square 2-(176,50,14) design with group HS acting
doubly transitively on points and quadrics. It is self-dual,
with HS.2 interchanging points and quadrics.
Up to conjugacy there are two polarities, one with 80 and
one with 176 absolute points. Using one of the latter type
we can write the incidence matrix as a symmetric matrix A+I,
and A is the adjacency matrix of a strongly regular graph
with parameters v=176, k=49, &lambda;=12, &mu;=14, and group
S<sub>8</sub> with vertex orbit sizes 8+168.
For the relation with &Gamma;, see below.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
We give the substructures of &Gamma; associated to the 11 maximal
subgroups of G distinct from HS, sorted according to increasing orbit size.
<p>
a) <i>A vertex</i>.
<br>
There are 100 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one (in the full automorphism group)
is M<sub>22</sub>.2 with vertex orbit sizes 1+22+77.
The subgraph induced on the second subconstituent is
the <a href="M22.html">M22 graph</a>, the unique
strongly regular graph with v=77, k=16, &lambda;=0.
<p>
b) <i>A split into two Hoffman-Singleton graphs</i>.
<br>
There are 352 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer is U<sub>3</sub>(5).2 with vertex orbit size 100.
(That such splits exist is shown in the description of the
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>,
where the Higman-Sims graph is constructed on the 100
15-cocliques of the Hoffman-Singleton graph.)
<p>
Under HS these 352 fall into two families of size 176,
and HS acts doubly transtively on both. This is the Higman geometry
of 176 points and 176 quadrics.
<p>
The 704 Hoffman-Singleton subgraphs of &Gamma; meet in
0,50 (1x), 15,35 (50x), 20,30 (175x), or 25,25 (126x) points.
The point-quadric incidence in Higman's geometry corresponds
to the 15,35,15,35 intersection of the corresponding splits.
<p>
c) <i>An edge</i>.
<br>
There are 1100 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>3</sub>(4):2<sup>2</sup>
with vertex orbit sizes 2+42+56.
The subgraph induced on the 42 is the point-line incidence graph
of the projective plane PG(2,4).
The subgraph induced on the 56 is the
<a href="Sims-Gewirtz.html">Gewirtz graph</a>.
<p>
d) <i>A PG(3,2) point-plane nonincidence graph</i>
<br>
As we saw, &Gamma; contains the bipartite point-plane nonincidence
graph of PG(3,2). There are 1100 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>8</sub>&times;2 with vertex orbit sizes 30+70.
The subgraph induced on the 30 is our point-plane nonincidence graph
of PG(3,2). It is distance-regular with intersection array {8,7,4;1,4,8}.
The subgraph induced on the 70 is the graph on the 4-subsets of an 8-set,
adjacent when they meet in a single element.
<p>
Let us describe this in terms of the <a href="S.html">Steiner system</a>
S(5,8,24). Pick two symbols <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and let S(3,6,22)
consist of the 77 octads on <i>a</i>,<i>b</i> (with these elements removed).
Pick an octad B not containing <i>a</i>,<i>b</i>.
The 77 blocks of S(3,6,22) now split 14+56+7 for having 4,2,0 symbols
in common with B, and in the 1+22+77 construction of &Gamma;,
the (1+14)+(8+7) induces the point-plane nonincidence graph of PG(3,2).
<p>
If we want to extend this 15+15 to a split into 50+50 defined by
some octad C containg <i>a</i> but not <i>b</i>, then C must be
disjoint from B, and we have 8 choices. And if {B,C,D} is a partition
of the set of 24 symbols, then D defines the complementary split
(the 35's switch sides).
<p>
The objects we found here are known as <i>conics</i> in Higman's geometry.
They are K<sub>8,8</sub>'s in the point-quadric incidence graph:
sets of 8 points contained in 8 quadrics. Each pair of points is in
precisely two conics, and their union is contained in two quadrics.
Dually, the intersection of two quadrics (of size 14) contains two conics
that meet in two points. The conic B defines a polarity by sending
the point C to the quadric D when {B,C,D} is as above.
<p>
e) <i>A non-edge</i>.
<br>
There are 3850 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>5</sup>.S<sub>6</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 2+6+32+60.
The subgraph induced on the 32 is the folded 6-cube.
The subgraph induced on the 60 is the second subconstituent
of the <a href="M22.html">M22 graph</a>.
<p>
<!--f) *** N(2A^3)
There are 4125 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 4<sup>3</sup>:(L<sub>3</sub>(2)&times;2)
with vertex orbit sizes ***-->
<p>
g) <i>2-coclique extension of the Petersen graph</i>.
<br>
There are 5775 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sub>+</sub><sup>1+6</sup>:S<sub>5</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 20+80.
The subgraph induced on the 20 is the 2-coclique extension of the
<a href="Petersen.html">Petersen graph</a>. (The one on 80 is messy.)
<!--There is an outer involution of HS that fixes this subgraph
pointwise.
<p>
&Gamma; contains 1108800 copies of the bipartite double of the
Petersen graph. Irrelevant.-->
<p>
<!--h) ***
There are 11200 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is M<sub>11</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes ***-->
<p>
i)  <i>Pair of splits from the same family</i>.
<br>
In terms of Higman's geometry: a pair of points.
(Note that a pair of points determines a pair of quadrics
and vice versa.)
There are 15400 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is (2&times;A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup>).2
with vertex orbit sizes ***40+60***
<p>
j) <i>Partitions into four 5C<sub>5</sub></i>.
<br>
As we saw, for each of the 176 50+50 splits from one family there are
126 from the other family such that the common refinement is 25+25+25+25.
Thus, there are 176*126 = 22176 such unordered pairs of splits,
and these form a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 5<sub>+</sub><sup>1+2</sup>:[2<sup>5</sup>]
with vertex orbit size 100.
<p>
k) <i>Good partitions into ten {4,3,1;1,3,4}</i>.
<br>
&Gamma; contains 61600 subgraphs isomorphic to
K<sub>5,5</sub> minus a matching, the complement of the 2&times;5 grid,
the unique distance-regular graph with intersection array {4,3,1;1,3,4},
the bipartite double of the complete graph K<sub>5</sub>.
For brevity, let us call such a graph a BD(K<sub>5</sub>).
These subgraphs form a single orbit, with stabilizer
6.A<sub>5</sub>.2<sup>2</sup> of order 1440 and vertex orbit sizes 10+30+60.
<!--The 6 acts trivially on this subgraph.-->
Counting is easy in the 1+22+77 construction: such a subgraph containing
the 1 is uniquely determined by 4 symbols not in a block (and we find the
four blocks that contain 3 of the 4 symbols, and the unique block
disjoint from the previous four blocks).
<p>
On the 30 the induced subgraph is the point-plane nonincidence graph
of PG(3,2). Now this graph has a unique split (up to isomorphism)
into three BD(K<sub>5</sub>)'s, since the point-plane
incidence graph has a unique split into three 5K<sub>2</sub>'s.
(Description: Let PG(3,2) have points and hyperplanes given by the
nonzero elements of GF(16), where x is incident with y when
Tr(xy) = 0. Since the only cube of trace 0 is 1, partitioning
points and planes according to exponent mod 3 works.)
<p>
Our object is a partition of &Gamma; into ten BD(K<sub>5</sub>)'s
where this set of ten carries the structure of a Petersen graph,
and for each BD(K<sub>5</sub>) the subgraph induced on the union of
its three neighbours is the point-plane nonincidence graph of PG(3,2).
There are 36960 *** of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 5:4 &times; S<sub>5</sub>
with vertex orbit size 100.
<!--
Each vertex has 4 neighbours in its own BD(K<sub>5</sub>)
and 2 neighbours in each of the remaining 9.
-->
<p>
This description is a bit involved, but just saying
"Partition into ten BD(K<sub>5</sub>)'s" is not enough:
&Gamma; has a very large number of such partitions.
