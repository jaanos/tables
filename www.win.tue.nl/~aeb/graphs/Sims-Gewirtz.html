<H1>Sims-Gewirtz graph</H1>
There is a unique strongly regular graph with parameters
<i>v</i> = 56, <i>k</i> = 10, &lambda; = 0, &mu; = 2.
The spectrum is 10<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>35</sup> (–4)<sup>20</sup>.
This graph was found by Sims and studied by Gewirtz,
who also proved uniqueness. It is commonly called the Gewirtz graph,
or the Sims-Gewirtz graph.
<p>
<H2>Group</H2>
The full group of automorphisms is G = L<sub>3</sub>(4).2<sup>2</sup>
(of order 2<sup>8</sup>.3<sup>2</sup>.5.7) acting rank 3, with point
stabilizer A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup>.
The eight different types of maximal subgroups of G are all
recognized below as stabilizers of subgraphs.
<p>
<H2>Construction</H2>
The graph is the subgraph of the
<a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a> induced
on the set of vertices at distance 2 from two adjacent vertices
(and this construction shows the full group).
<p>
It can also be described as the graph on the 77–21 = 56 blocks
of the (unique) <a href="S.html">Steiner system</a> S(3,6,22)
not containing a fixed symbol, adjacent when they are disjoint.
Or, equivalently, as the graph on the 56 hyperovals from one
L<sub>3</sub>(4) orbit in PG(2,4), adjacent when they are disjoint.
Or again, equivalently, as the graph on the 56 <a href="S.html">octads</a>
that contain two given symbols a,b but not a third symbol c, where
two octads are adjacent when they meet in just {a,b}.
<p>
<H2>Biplane</H2>
Adding an identity matrix to its adjacency matrix yields a
biplane 2-(56,11,2).
<p>
<H2>Supergraphs</H2>
This graph is subgraph of the <a href="M22.html">M<sub>22</sub> graph</a>
on 77 vertices, the <a href="Higman-Sims.html">Higman-Sims graph</a>
on 100 vertices, the <a href="U4_3.html">U<sub>4</sub>(3) graph</a>
on 112 vertices, the McL graph on 275 vertices
and the <a href="G24.html">G<sub>2</sub>(4) graph</a> on 416 vertices.
<p>
<H2>Subgraphs</H2>
a) <i>A vertex</i>.
There are 56 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one (in the full automorphism group)
is A<sub>6</sub>.2<sup>2</sup> with vertex orbit sizes 1+10+45.
<p>
b) <i>An edge</i>.
There are 280 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 3<sup>2</sup>:Q<sub>8</sub>.2&times;2
with vertex orbit sizes 2+18+36.
In PG(2,4) these can be identified with the unitals (AG(2,3) subplanes):
the complement of the union of two disjoint hyperovals is a unital.
The graph on the 280 edges, where two edges are adjacent when they
are opposite edges of a quadrangle, is distance-transitive with
intersection array {9,8,6,3;1,1,3,8} and spectrum
9<sup>1</sup> 4<sup>64</sup> 1<sup>105</sup> (–3)<sup>90</sup>
(–5)<sup>20</sup>. Its automorphism group Aut (L<sub>3</sub>(4))
is three times larger than that of the Gewirtz graph.
The uniqueness of this graph (given its parameters) was shown by Lambeck.
<p>
c) <i>A 16-coclique</i>.
There are 42 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>4</sup>.S<sub>5</sub>
with vertex orbit sizes 16+40.
In the Higman-Sims graph these are visible as point neighbourhoods.
Also in PG(2,4) these 16-cocliques are visible: each point is
in 16 of our hyperovals, and these hyperovals are mutually nonadjacent.
Moreover, each hyperoval has six exterior lines forming a dual hyperoval,
and disjoint hyperovals have disjoint dual hyperovals; it follows that
the 21 lines of PG(2,4) also give 16-cocliques.
The graph on the 16-cocliques, adjacent when disjoint, is the point-line
incidence graph of PG(2,4). Distance 0,1,2,3 in this graph corresponds
to an intersection of size 16,0,4,6, respectively.
<p>
d) <i>6 C<sub>4</sub></i>.
There are 105 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is 2<sup>2+4</sup>.3.2<sup>2</sup>
with vertex orbit sizes 24+32.
Each quadrangle determines a unique subgraph 6 C<sub>4</sub>,
and hence there are 105 such subgraphs. The complement of one is the
bipartite point-block incidence graph of AG(2,4) from which a
parallel class of lines has been removed.
In particular, we find partitions of the Gewirtz graph into
one subgraph 6 C<sub>4</sub> and two 16-cocliques. This pair
of 16-cocliques can be viewed as a flag in PG(2,4).
There are no other regular subgraphs of valency 2 on 24 vertices.
<p>
e) <i>10 K<sub>2</sub> and Sylvester</i>.
There are 112 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is M<sub>10</sub> with vertex orbit sizes 20+36.
<p>
A hyperoval of a non-chosen orbit meets our hyperovals in 1 or 3 points;
20 in 3 (each triple occurs once) and 36 in 1.
This induces a partition of the graph into two subgraphs, one isomorphic
to 10 K<sub>2</sub>, the other to the
<a href="Sylvester.html">Sylvester graph</a> (distance-regular
with intersection array {5,4,2;1,1,4} on 36 vertices).
<p>
A different way to see this is to look at the Higman-Sims graph.
It has splits into two
<a href="Hoffman-Singleton.html">Hoffman-Singleton graph</a>s.
Choosing an edge in one of the Hoffman-Singleton graphs we find that
the subgraph of the Higman-Sims graph far away from that edge is split
into a Sylvester graph and a 10 K<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
A different way to see the presence of subgraphs 10 K<sub>2</sub>
is by looking at the generalized quadrangle GQ(3,9) on 112
vertices. It has splits into two Gewirtz graphs, and the ten lines
on a point on one side meet the other side in 10 K<sub>2</sub>.
<p>
f) <i>co-Heawood graph</i>.
(The <a href="Heawood.html">co-Heawood graph</a> is the point-line
nonincidence graph of the Fano plane.)
There are 120 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is L<sub>2</sub>(7):2&times;2
with vertex orbit sizes 7+7+42.
Their presence can be seen from the M<sub>24</sub> construction:
if our Gewirtz graph consists of the octads starting 110, then
fix an octad B starting 001. There are 7, 42, 7 octads in our graph
that meet B in 4, 2, 0 vertices, respectively, and the 7+7 induces
a co-Heawood graph. The involution in M<sub>24</sub> that fixes B
pointwise, and fixes the pair contained in all Gewirtz octads
fixes the co-Heawood graph pointwise. There is no automorphism
here interchanging the two 7-cocliques in the co-Heawood graph.
<p>
g) <i>Splits into two Coxeter graphs</i>.
The Gewirtz graph has 240 splits into two Coxeter graphs, forming
a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one split is L<sub>2</sub>(7):2 with vertex orbit
sizes 28+28.
<p>
These splits can be seen inside the Higman-Sims graph.
It has splits into two Hoffman-Singleton graphs. Choosing an edge
that meets both sides we find that the subgraph of the Higman-Sims graph
far away from that edge is split into two
<a href="Coxeter.html">Coxeter graph</a>s.
<p>
A different way to see these is to look at the M<sub>24</sub> construction:
if our Gewirtz graph consists of the octads starting 110, then fix an
octad B starting 100 or 010. There are 28, 28 octads in our graph that
meet B in 3, 1 vertices, respectively, and thus each B gives a split.
<p>
h) <i>Extended bipartite double of the Petersen graph</i>.
There are 336 of these, forming a single orbit.
The stabilizer of one is S<sub>5</sub>&times;2
with vertex orbit sizes 6+20+30.
The extended bipartite double of the Petersen graph has 20 vertices
and spectrum 4<sup>1</sup> 2<sup>5</sup> 1<sup>4</sup>
(–1)<sup>4</sup> (–2)<sup>5</sup> (–4)<sup>1</sup>.
Inside the Higman-Sims graph it can be seen by taking a path
a ~ b ~ c ~ d of length 3, and taking the 20 vertices adjacent to
one of a, d and none of b, c.
<p>
<H2><i>p</i>-rank</H2>
The adjacency matrix A of the Gewirtz graph has 2-rank 20,
5-rank 55, and <i>p</i>-rank 56 for all other <i>p</i>.
The matrix A+I has 3-rank 20, 11-rank 55, and <i>p</i>-rank 56
for all other <i>p</i>.
<p>
<H2>Independence and chromatic number</H2>
The Gewirtz graph has independence number 16 and chromatic number 4.
The complement of the Gewirtz graph has independence number 2
and chromatic number 28.
<p>
<H2>Cocliques</H2>
Maximal cocliques have sizes 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 16.
For the 16-cocliques, see c) above. For the 7-cocliques, see f) above.

</pre>
A colouring with 4 colours must use two disjoint 16-cocliques.
The complement of their union is the union of six quadrangles,
in particular bipartite. Any 2-colouring of this 6 C<sub>4</sub> either
determines two maximal 12-cocliques, or a maximal 12-coclique
and a 16-coclique. See also d) above.
